                        The aim of the app is to provide emotional wellbeing support in the form of an AI coach and the provision of a range of digital self-help tools and exercises in a self-help and self-monitoring context. The app can help with general mental health but not with severe or enduring physical or mental health conditions. The AI Coach is an AI technology powered software, not a real person, so it is restricted in the means of response. If you need medical advice, it will suggest that you see a local professional.

If it does not, we do not release the Output, instead providing a pre-defined safe response.

                                At Wysa, we use artificial intelligence (AI) programs to understand what you type to us. These programs help us talk with you in a way that makes sense and guides you to helpful information. Our programs follow set rules and do not learn new things on their own. We make sure our AI chatbot is fair, safe, and treats your information with care. If you use the Gen AI or Wysa+ service, we use Generative AI technology to assist you. We have safety measures in place to keep our conversations secure and trustworthy. We also have good practices to monitor and check the use of AI at Wysa, making sure your rights are protected.

Due to the nature of the technology, you may sometimes get incorrect responses that do not accurately reflect the action required.

If you think we have any personal data of your child, please write to us. We will respond within one month after verifying the information. If we cannot identify the user correctly, we might not be able to address your request.

                                    Always lock your mobile screen with a password. Make sure it is strong and do not share it with anyone. Never leave your device alone.

                                <li>
                                    Always update your mobile’s operating system to the latest version.

                                    Turn on remote access on your device so you can find and control it if it gets stolen.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Install anti-virus software to protect your device from viruses.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Be careful with emails. Do not open files, click on links, or download anything from sources you do not know.
                                </li>

                                    Be smart about using Wi-Fi. Before sending personal or important data over a public Wi-Fi in places like a coffee shop or airport, check if the network is safe.
