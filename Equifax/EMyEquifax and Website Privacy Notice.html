In addition, some of our service providers may have processing operations in other jurisdictions.</p><p>While data protection laws in some jurisdictions may not provide the same level of protection to your personal data as it is provided under UK data protection laws, Equifax takes steps to ensure the appropriate protections are in place before knowingly transferring personal data outside of the UK/EEA.</p><p>Non-UK Website Users: The Website is intended for users within the United Kingdom.

Equifax US adheres to the EU-U.S. DPF Principles for consumer data. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Notice and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern.

In the context of an onward transfer, Equifax has responsibility for processing personal data it receives under the DPF and subsequently transfers to a third party for external processing. If personal data received under the DPF is transferred to a third party, the third party&#x27;s access, use, and disclosure of personal data must also be in compliance with our DPF obligations, and we will remain liable under the DPF for any failure to do so by the third party unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. </p><p>If you have a question or complaint related to participation in the DPF, we encourage you to contact the Data Protection Officer using the contact details provided in <em>Section 1. How Can you Contact Us?</em>. Please reference “<em>Data Privacy Framework</em>” when contacting us about the DPF.

Individuals seeking additional information can visit the <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/framework-article/ANNEX-I-introduction"><strong>DPF Annex I</strong></a> for more information.
