If you opt-out or unsubscribe from all email from the Company while remaining a registered user or Customer, you will become ineligible for receipt of and use of our services.</p><p>Export: You agree that our services are subject to U.S. export controls and agree that you will comply with the same, and represent that you are neither located in a sanctioned country nor a prohibited person. You agree not to export, re-export, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from Company, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.</p><p>Entire Agreement: This Terms of Use constitutes the sole Agreement between you and the Company relating to your use of the Service Content, and no representations, statements or inducements, oral or written, not contained in this Agreement shall bind either you or the Company.</p><p>Severability: We both agree that if we cannot enforce a part of these Terms of Use as written due to a conflict with state or federal law, then that part will be replaced with terms that most closely match the intent of the part we cannot enforce to the extent permitted by law. The invalidity of part of these Terms of Use will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.</p><p>No Assignment: You may not assign, transfer or delegate your rights or obligations within these Terms of Use in whole or in part without our prior written consent. We may freely transfer, assign or delegate all or any part of these Terms of Use, and any rights and duties hereunder or there under. These Terms of Use shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the parties, their heirs, successors and permitted assignees of the parties.</p><p>No Waiver: Failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right hereunder, or failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Use, shall not be considered waiver thereof, which can only be made by signed writing. No waiver by the Company of any right under this Terms of Use Agreement will be deemed to be either a waiver of any other right or provision or a waiver of that same right or provision at any other time.</p><p>Jurisdiction: The Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA and controlling United States Federal Law without regard to any conflicts of law provisions. Subject to the provisions of this Terms of Use, all disputes, controversies or claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be resolved through mandatory binding arbitration that will be conducted in Contra Costa County, California as provided below.</p><p>Arbitration: This agreement contains an arbitration provision to resolve disputes. No class or representative court action or jury trial is permitted. Arbitration is the referral of a dispute to one or more impartial persons for a final and binding determination, and means that there shall not be a jury and that the rules of the proceeding will be conducted in accordance with established arbitration rules of the AAA. In order to resolve a dispute with as minimum expense and maximum satisfaction as possible, we recommend contacting us first to resolve any dispute in as easy a fashion as possible, but you are permitted to proceed directly to arbitration, provided that before initiating arbitration, you first send notice to the Company to support@x2ai.com. Any dispute must be initiated with an AAA arbitrator in Contra Costa County, California, within one year of occurrence or to the maximum extent permitted by law. Any dispute that arises may only be resolved through an individual arbitration, and shall not be brought as a class action, a class arbitration, or any other proceeding where a person serves as the representative of any other person or persons. You agree that there is no right to a jury trial, and this provision will be governed both substantively and procedurally by the AAA to the maximum extent permitted by law. The selected arbitrator is without jurisdiction to conduct a class arbitration or other representative proceeding, and may not consolidate one person’s claims with another. Both parties must keep the dispute confidential, to the maximum extent permitted by law. As in the rest of this Terms of Use, if one part of this arbitration agreement is found to be invalid, the invalid provision shall be severed from the rest of this arbitration clause and agreement and the rest of this clause and agreement shall be valid.</p><p>General: The performance of Company hereunder is subject to interruption and delay due to causes beyond its reasonable control including acts of God, acts of government, war, civil disorder, fire, power failure, equipment failure, labor dispute, inability to obtain necessary supplies, and the like. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any applicable law, it shall be deemed omitted and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. This Agreement may be modified only in writing authorized by Company. Company&#x27;s waiver of any right shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other right in the future.</p><p>Survival: Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the following provisions shall survive termination or expiration of the Agreement: Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability; Assumption of Risks; Indemnification; Intellectual Property; Third-Party Content; Miscellaneous Terms.</p><p>These terms also apply to Coach Cabi on Google Home, which action is named &quot;Talk to Coach Cabi&quot;, developed by X2AI Inc.</p><p><br/></p><p>This service, located at x2.ai and tess.ai, and any mobile application or platform connected or associated with this website, and any information stored therein as well as any products and services offered through any of the foregoing (collectively, &quot;Service&quot;), are owned and operated by X2AI, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &quot;Company,&quot; “we,” “us,” or “our”).
