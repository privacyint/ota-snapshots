Wysa+ uses third-party Generative AI (“Gen AI”) and our own AI to chat with you. This helps the AI Coach talk about varied conversations and provide responses that are more suited to you. Where provided, Wysa+ allows you to chat in native English and other languages. Your conversation data is processed to provide this service. The output from the Gen AI passes through our safety guardrails and quality checks before we use it. Our clinical staff review the appropriateness of the Gen AI response  at frequent intervals to make sure they are safe, and work well.

If it does not, we do not release the Output, instead providing a pre-defined safe response.

                                At Wysa, we use artificial intelligence (AI) programs to understand what you type to us. These programs help us talk with you in a way that makes sense and guides you to helpful information. Our programs follow set rules and do not learn new things on their own. We make sure our AI chatbot is fair, safe, and treats your information with care. If you use the Wysa+ service, we use third-party Generative AI technology to assist you. We have safety measures in place to keep our conversations secure and trustworthy. We also have good practices to monitor and check the use of AI at Wysa, making sure your rights are protected.

Due to the nature of the technology, you may sometimes get incorrect responses that do not accurately reflect the action required.</p>
                            <p>We do our best to keep your personal data safe, but no method is perfect. We cannot promise complete security. You can help keep your data safe too. Please do not share personal identifiers where not asked. Please do not copy and share your chats with people you do not know.</p>
