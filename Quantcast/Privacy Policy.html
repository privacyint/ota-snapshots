In addition, these Terms only apply to the Quantcast Measure service (i.e., the &ldquo;</em><strong><em>Service</em></strong><em>&rdquo; as described below) and not to any other Quantcast product or service.</em></div><div><strong>Quantcast Measure Terms of Service</strong></div><p>This Quantcast Measure Terms of Service (this <strong><em>&ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;</em>) </strong>describes the terms and conditions on which Quantcast makes Quantcast Measure (the <strong><em>&ldquo;Services&rdquo;</em>) </strong>available to you.</p><p>BY CLICKING THE &ldquo;I ACCEPT&rdquo; BUTTON, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, USING THE SERVICES OR ENTERING INTO AN OFFLINE AGREEMENT THAT REFERENCES THIS AGREEMENT OR INCLUDES A LINK TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS &ldquo;YOU&rdquo; OR &ldquo;YOUR&rdquo; WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY (OR, IF SUCH ENTITY IS ACTING AS AN AUTHORIZED AFFILIATE, THEN THE TERMS &ldquo;YOU&rdquo; OR &ldquo;YOUR&rdquo; WILL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, THE AUTHORIZING PARTY(IES), OR BOTH, AS APPLICABLE). QUANTCAST MAY MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME; CONTINUED USE 30 DAYS AFTER NOTIFICATION WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE (SEE SECTION 10).</p><p>Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in Section 14.</p><p>This Agreement incorporates the <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum"><u>US State Data Privacy Addendum</u></a> to the extent that the Services include processing personal information that is subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws (as defined in the foregoing Addendum) and the <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#privacy-implementation-for-quantcast-publisher-partners"><u>Privacy Implementation for</u> <u>Quantcast Publisher Partners</u>.</a></p><div style="line-height: 1.5;"><br /></div><div><strong>1. Introduction: Reachpoints, Tags, and Measurement Data.</strong></div><p>Quantcast Measure is a free digital audience measurement service that allows you to tag web pages, video, advertisements, apps, content, and paid search campaigns (what we call, <strong>&ldquo;<em>Reachpoints</em>&rdquo;) </strong>for direct measurement.</p><p>You can also define and measure actions and events by customizing your Tags with labels. You have complete control over (and are solely responsible for) which Reachpoints are tagged, how segments are labelled (e.g., with meaningful or obfuscated names), and how the resulting Measurement Results are or are not disclosed publicly.</p><p>Each time a browser visits your tagged Reachpoints, Quantcast may, in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws, collect traffic statistics like those in any web server log (what we call, <strong>&ldquo;<em>Measurement Data</em>&rdquo;</strong>). We then apply proprietary Quantcast algorithms and other data to the Measurement Data to generate the <strong>&ldquo;<em>Measurement Results</em>&rdquo;, </strong>which we make available to you on the Quantcast website (see Section 3).</p><p>To measure Reachpoints that you do not own or control, you may provide your Tag to a third party who accepts this Agreement (any such third party, an <strong><em>&ldquo;Authorized Affiliate&rdquo;</em></strong>); you may also instruct us to give the Authorized Affiliate access to the Measurement Results.</p><div><br /></div><div><strong>2. Registration.</strong></div><p>In order to access the Services you must register for a Quantcast account on the Quantcast website. Each new app you Tag requires its own registration and then receives its own unique API key. In registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information, and to keep it up to date. Any processing of Personal Information when registering for a Quantcast account will be processed in accordance with the Quantcast Website and Corporate Privacy Policy which you can access <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#quantcast-website-and-corporate-privacy-policy"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p>You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. You hereby take responsibility for all actions taken&mdash;and instructions</p><p>provided to Quantcast&mdash;under your account or with the Measurement Results, by you or any third parties, whether or not authorized. You will notify Quantcast immediately of any unauthorized or non-compliant use of your account and will cooperate with us in stopping it.</p><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Heebo,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><strong>3. Measurement Data and Results.</strong></span></div><p>Quantcast uses each piece of Measurement Data both to understand your audience (for your benefit only) and as one of trillions of data points for predictive analytics and in determining what content and advertising to show individuals across the internet and other digital applications. You acknowledge that Quantcast may use Personal Information it receives from you to provide services to other Quantcast clients or for Quantcast&rsquo;s commercial interests that may be unrelated to providing the Services to you.</p><p>Quantcast will never sell your audience (whether identified as such or not) and you control the extent to which Quantcast displays the Measurement Results.</p><p>Quantcast grants you perpetual rights to use, copy, and distribute the Measurement Results, including with our sharable widgets, only as long as you:</p><ol><li>Credit Us. Conspicuously include: &ldquo;Source: Quantcast <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/"><u>www.quantcast.com</u></a>&rdquo;;</li><li>Present the Measurement Results Exactly as We Provided It. Do not: (i) manipulate or modify the Measurement Results to state or suggest different results from those specifically presented by Quantcast; (ii) combine information related to different Quantcast profiles (for example, by adding together the reach from two different sites instead of presenting the cross-site unduplicated reach measurement provided by Quantcast); (iii) quantitatively aggregate or combine information in the Measurement Results with information derived from other sources (but offering a comparison with information derived from other sources is permissible);</li><li>Don&rsquo;t Use Our Work to Compete with Us. Do not use the information in the Measurement Results in any way that competes with Quantcast; and</li><li>Bind Third Parties. If you provide the information in the Measurement Results directly to any third party (rather than by having them access the information through the Quantcast website), you must ensure that they agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of this Agreement including the foregoing requirements.</li></ol><div><br /></div><div><strong>4. Tagging Rules and Privacy.</strong></div><p>You agree not to misrepresent your digital traffic, audience, or user activity in connection with Quantcast, the Services, or any Tags. You agree not to tag any adware or spyware inventory, or any Reachpoint revealing precise geographic location (i.e., information that describes the precise location of a device derived through any technology that is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an individual or device), specific health / medical /sex-life information, credit card or financial data, or criminal convictions or charges. In addition, you agree not to tag any Reachpoint revealing data regarded as &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; or &ldquo;special category&rdquo; Personal Information under Applicable Privacy Laws, including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or health. You further agree not to tag any website that contains information about health conditions or treatments or that might otherwise reveal or suggest an individual&rsquo;s health status or treatment. If you represent to Quantcast (e.g., during the signup process) that your Reachpoints are directed to users under the age of 16, Quantcast will not collect any Personal Information from such Reachpoints and you will not receive those of our services that require collection of data across different websites. You will not modify the Tag other than as described in a <a href="https://help.quantcast.com/hc/en-us"><u>Quantcast Learning Center Guide</u></a>. You agree to update your Tag (which may require retagging your Reachpoints) when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades. You will use the Tag in the top most frame possible. You will retain the Tag&rsquo;s origin address that we provided, in full.</p><p>You agree to comply with Applicable Privacy Laws and also industry self-regulation Principles and Codes of Conduct for interest-based advertising in connection with your use of the Tag and the Services. You agree not to use the Services to track or collect personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can be used to contact or identify a particular individual, including name, address, telephone number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier) of end users. To the extent that the web</p><p>pages or apps in which you place the Technology are accessed by end users located in Europe, you agree to implement a transparency and consent solution compatible with the <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/tcf"><u>IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework</u></a> or another solution mutually agreed by both parties in writing. While you are implementing such consent solution, you agree to (i) obtain consent for Quantcast to use cookies and similar technologies in compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws, (ii) provide proof of such consent if requested by Quantcast, and</p><p>(iii) not permit calls from your web pages or apps to Quantcast servers if such consent has not be obtained. You agree to name Quantcast as a party for or by whom cookies or similar technologies are used to access the device and Personal Information is collected through your webpages or apps.</p><p>You further agree to prominently display to end users a user friendly, easily accessible, clear and comprehensive privacy policy (and, if necessitated by Applicable Privacy Laws, a separate cookie policy) that, where required, complies with Applicable Privacy Laws and contains the following (a) a statement that your site or app permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the types of data collected for such advertising, (iii) an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by, or transferred to, third parties, and (iv) a conspicuous link to either an opt-out mechanism, such as the NAI or DAA opt-outs for companies established outside of Europe or a consent revocation page for companies established in Europe. If you use the Services to collect data from a network of domains or subdomains, you will inform each in advance of such disclosures.</p><p>In the case of app measurement, operating system platforms provide device-level setting options that allow end users to indicate their preference with respect to third party data collection and targeted advertising (the <strong>&ldquo;<em>Ad Preference Setting</em>&rdquo;</strong>). Quantcast treats these device level Ad Preference Settings as consumer opt-outs and you will accurately pass the Ad Preference Setting to Quantcast. You will not send any identifier associated with a device to the extent that such device has otherwise indicated that the end user wishes to be opted out of advertisement tracking.</p><p>Unless agreed otherwise, you and Quantcast are each separate and independent Businesses or Controllers of any Personal Information which you and we may disclose or receive under this Agreement. You and Quantcast, pursuant to this Agreement, do not and will not jointly determine the purposes or the means of Processing of any Personal Information disclosed or received under this Agreement.</p><p>Each party shall comply with the obligations that apply to it under Applicable Privacy Laws and provide Personal Information Processed pursuant to this Agreement the level of privacy protection required by such laws. In the event that either party determines that it can no longer meet its privacy obligations under this Agreement or the Privacy Laws, it shall inform the other party without undue delay.</p><p>If you are a Business subject to CCPA, you agree to prominently post a &ldquo;Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information&rdquo; link on all of your Reachpoints, and to provide consumers with the disclosures required of Businesses by CCPA.</p><p>You represent and warrant that you are not a covered entity under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (&ldquo;HIPAA&rdquo;), and you do not have equivalent status under comparable local or international laws and regulations.</p><div><br /></div><div><strong>5. Restrictions.</strong></div><p>You agree to use the Services only in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You will not use the Services to engage in any illegal or offensive acts or serve any illegal content via any Reachpoint. You will not:</p><ol><li>Interfere or attempt to interfere with the operation or security-related features of the Services or the Technology;</li><li>Delete, or in any manner alter, the copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices appearing on any Quantcast Content;</li><li>Represent that Quantcast endorses or supports your services; make any representations and warranties concerning any aspect of the Services, the Technology, or Measurement Results to any Authorized Third Parties or other third parties; or</li><li>Attempt to index, scrape, search, or crawl the Services or the Quantcast website with any automated process; or attempt to access any information or technology relating to the Services, the Quantcast website, or our proprietary algorithms through any means not intentionally made available by Quantcast to you.</li></ol><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: Heebo,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><strong>6. Quantcast Rights.</strong></span></div><p>All right, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Quantcast website, the Services, the Technology, and the Quantcast Content are and will remain the exclusive property of Quantcast (<strong>&ldquo;<em>Quantcast Property</em>&rdquo;</strong>). Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, you will not reproduce, modify, or prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly</p><p>display, publicly perform, transmit, or use such Quantcast Property. In the event that your Quantcast account is suspended or terminated, Quantcast will continue to respect this Agreement&rsquo;s limits on our use of the Measurement Data and will cease all public display of the Measurement Results.</p><p>Quantcast servers may choose to occasionally respond to any publisher&rsquo;s Tag by redirecting the browser to a third-party anonymous beacon to support the provision of Quantcast services in market. The decision to beacon is not related to you, your traffic, or your user base.</p><div><br /></div><div><strong>7. Indemnity.</strong></div><p>Quantcast agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) resulting from a third-party claim that the Technology or the Services infringe any U.S. or European intellectual property rights, provided that you (i) promptly inform and furnish Quantcast with a copy of each related communication and action, (ii) allow Quantcast to assume full control of the defense and settlement, and (iii) assist and cooperate with Quantcast, at Quantcast&rsquo;s expense. Quantcast will have no obligation or liability hereunder where the claim results from any combination with, addition to, or modification of the Services or the Technology, from your failure to update your Tag, from your or any Authorized Affiliate breach of this Agreement, or from failure to obtain consent for your and our use of cookies or other tracking technology in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws. If the Services or Technology become, or, in Quantcast&rsquo;s opinion are likely to become, the subject of a third-party claim against you, Quantcast may, at its option and expense, procure rights for you to continue using the Services or the Technology, replace or modify the same so that it performs substantially similar functions but does not infringe, or terminate this Agreement. <strong>The foregoing states the sole and exclusive liability of Quantcast and your sole remedy with respect to third party claims of any kind.</strong></p><p>You agree to indemnify and hold Quantcast harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) resulting from a third-party claim resulting from your failure to update your Tag when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades.</p><div><br /></div><div><strong>8. Warranty Disclaimer.</strong></div><p><strong>The services and related information are provided &ldquo;as is,&rdquo; without warranty or condition of any kind, either express or implied. Without limiting the foregoing, Quantcast explicitly disclaims any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, or non-infringement. Quantcast makes no warranty that the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content will (1) meet your requirements, (2) be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis, or (3) not cause any latency or processing delays. Quantcast is under no obligation to retain any Measurement Data or to keep the site up and running for any period of time. Quantcast makes no warranty regarding the accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness, or reliability of any information obtained through the Services, the Quantcast website, or the Quantcast content. No information, whether oral or written, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein. The foregoing exclusions and disclaimers are an essential part of this Agreement and formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer the Services to you. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain warranties so this disclaimer may not apply to you in full.</strong></p><div><br /></div><div><strong>9. Suspension and Termination.</strong></div><p>Unless otherwise terminated as set forth herein, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may terminate your Quantcast account and this Agreement at any time by both (i) &ldquo;dequantifying&rdquo; by deleting all Reachpoints from your profile on the Quantcast website (or, alternatively, by emailing <a href="mailto:contact@quantcast.com">contact@quantcast.com</a> (if you are resident in the US) or <a href="mailto:contact.dublin@quantcast.com">contact.dublin@quantcast.com</a> (if you are resident outside the US) with your complete account information and explicit request to terminate) and (ii) removing the Tags from all of your Reachpoints. Quantcast may terminate or suspend your access to the Services or terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or no reason and without any liability to you. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you under this Agreement will immediately cease. Quantcast will not be liable to you or any third party for</p><p>termination of this Agreement (whether by Quantcast or by you) or any termination or suspension of your use of the Services. Upon any termination or suspension, information in connection with your account may no longer be accessed by you. Notwithstanding the above, Sections 4 through 9, Sections 11 through 13, and the second paragraph of Section 3 will survive termination.</p><div><br /></div><div><strong>10. Modification of the Service and of the Terms.</strong></div><p>Quantcast reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or discontinue the Quantcast website and Services without notice. Quantcast may also modify this Agreement from time to time. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable to you, you may terminate your account within 30 days by following the two-step procedure described in Section 9. Use of the Quantcast website, use of any Tag to contact Quantcast&rsquo;s servers, or use of the Services will constitute your acceptance thereof.</p><div><br /></div><div><strong>11. Limitation of Liability.</strong></div><p><strong>In no event will Quantcast be liable to you or any third party for any consequential loss, exemplary damages, incidental loss, special damages or loss, lost profit, loss or deletion of Measurement Data or Measurement Results, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Services, even if Quantcast has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer these Services to you. This paragraph will apply regardless of any failure of the exclusive remedy provided in the following paragraph.</strong></p><p>Except with regard to Quantcast&rsquo;s obligations under Section 7, liability stemming from death or personal injury resulting from Quantcast&rsquo;s negligence, or Quantcast&rsquo;s fraud, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Quantcast&rsquo;s liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to two hundred fifty U.S. dollars (US$250.00).</p><div><br /></div><div><strong>12. Miscellaneous.</strong></div><p>This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties with respect to the Services and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, and communications, written or oral between Quantcast and you with respect thereto. Any agreements regarding the delivery or use of advertising segments will govern the parties&rsquo; relationship in connection with the applicable segments but will not affect the parties&rsquo; rights, restrictions, or obligations under this Agreement, which the parties acknowledge as separate subject matter. Any waiver by either party of any violation of this Agreement will not be deemed to waive any further or future violation of the same or any other provision. If any parts or provisions of this Agreement are held to be unenforceable, then you and Quantcast agree that such parts or provisions will be given maximum permissible force and effect and the remainder of the Agreement will be fully enforceable. You and Quantcast agree that there are no third party beneficiaries of any promises, obligations or representations made by Quantcast. Either Party may assign its rights, data, and duties, under this Agreement in their entirety in connection with a sale of all (or substantially all) of its assets relating to this Agreement, a merger, or a reorganization. Nothing in this Agreement will constitute a partnership or joint venture or joint controllership between you and Quantcast. <strong>This Agreement and any dispute relating to this Agreement will be governed by the laws of the United States and the laws of the State of California, without regard to U.S. or California choice of law rules. You and Quantcast agree and consent that jurisdiction, proper venue, and the most convenient forums for all claims, actions, and proceedings of any kind relating to Quantcast or the matters in this Agreement will be exclusively in courts located in San Francisco, California. </strong>This Agreement is drafted in the English language.

In addition, these Terms only apply to the Quantcast Measure service (i.e., the &ldquo;</em><strong><em>Service</em></strong><em>&rdquo; as described below) and not to any other Quantcast product or service.</em></p><p><strong>Quantcast Measure Terms of Service </strong></p><p>This Quantcast Measure Terms of Service (this<strong> <em>&ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;</em>) </strong>describes the terms and conditions on which Quantcast makes Quantcast Measure (the<strong> <em>&ldquo;Services&rdquo;</em>) </strong>available to you.</p><p>BY CLICKING THE &ldquo;I ACCEPT&rdquo; BUTTON, COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, USING THE SERVICES OR ENTERING INTO AN OFFLINE AGREEMENT THAT REFERENCES THIS AGREEMENT OR INCLUDES A LINK TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT.

QUANTCAST MAY MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME; CONTINUED USE 30 DAYS AFTER NOTIFICATION WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE (SEE SECTION 10).</p><p>Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in Section 14.</p><p>This Agreement incorporates the <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>US State Data Privacy Addendum</u></a> to the extent that the Services include processing personal information that is subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws (as defined in the foregoing Addendum) and the <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#privacy-implementation-for-quantcast-publisher-partners" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Publisher Partners</u></a>.</p><div><br /></div><div><strong>1.     Introducti</strong><strong>on: Reachpoints, Tags, and Measurement Data.</strong></div><p>Quantcast Measure is a free digital audience measurement service that allows you to tag web pages, video, advertisements, apps, content, and paid search campaigns (what we call, <strong>&ldquo;<em>Reachpoints</em>&rdquo;) </strong>for direct measurement.</p><p>You can also define and measure actions and events by customizing your Tags with labels. You have complete control over (and are solely responsible for) which Reachpoints are tagged, how segments are labelled (e.g., with meaningful or obfuscated names), and how the resulting Measurement Results are or are not disclosed publicly.</p><p>Each time a browser visits your tagged Reachpoints, Quantcast may, in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws, collect traffic statistics like those in any web server log (what we call, <strong>&ldquo;<em>Measurement Data</em>&rdquo;</strong>). We then apply proprietary Quantcast algorithms and other data to the Measurement Data to generate the <strong>&ldquo;<em>Measurement Results</em>&rdquo;, </strong>which we make available to you on the Quantcast website (see Section 3).</p><p>To measure Reachpoints that you do not own or control, you may provide your Tag to a third party who accepts this Agreement (any such third party, an <strong><em>&ldquo;Authorized Affiliate&rdquo;</em></strong>); you may also instruct us to give the Authorized Affiliate access to the Measurement Results.</p><div><br /></div><div><strong>2.     Registration.</strong></div><p>In order to access the Services you must register for a Quantcast account on the Quantcast website. Each new app you Tag requires its own registration and then receives its own unique API key. In registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information, and to keep it up to date. Any processing of Personal Information when registering for a Quantcast account will be processed in accordance with the Quantcast Website and Corporate Privacy Policy which you can access <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#quantcast-website-and-corporate-privacy-policy"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p>You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. You hereby take responsibility for all actions taken&mdash;and instructions provided to Quantcast&mdash;under your account or with the Measurement Results, by you or any third parties, whether or not authorized. You will notify Quantcast immediately of any unauthorized or non-compliant use of your account and will cooperate with us in stopping it.</p><div><br /></div><div><strong>3.     Measurement Data and Results.</strong></div><p>Quantcast uses each piece of Measurement Data both to understand your audience (for your benefit only) and as one of trillions of data points for predictive analytics and in determining what content and advertising to show individuals across the internet and other digital applications. You acknowledge that Quantcast may use Personal Information it receives from you to provide services to other Quantcast clients or for Quantcast&rsquo;s commercial interests that may be unrelated to providing the Services to you.</p><p>Quantcast will never sell your audience (whether identified as such or not) and you control the extent to which Quantcast displays the Measurement Results.</p><p>Quantcast grants you perpetual rights to use, copy, and distribute the Measurement Results, including with our sharable widgets, only as long as you:</p><ol><li>Credit Us. Conspicuously include: &ldquo;Source: Quantcast <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/"><u>www.quantcast.com</u></a>&rdquo;;</li><li>Present the Measurement Results Exactly as We Provided It. Do not: (i) manipulate or modify the Measurement Results to state or suggest different results from those specifically presented by Quantcast; (ii) combine information related to different Quantcast profiles (for example, by adding together the reach from two different sites instead of presenting the cross-site unduplicated reach measurement provided by Quantcast); (iii) quantitatively aggregate or combine information in the Measurement Results with information derived from other sources (but offering a comparison with information derived from other sources is permissible);</li><li>Don&rsquo;t Use Our Work to Compete with Us. Do not use the information in the Measurement Results in any way that competes with Quantcast; and</li><li>Bind Third Parties. If you provide the information in the Measurement Results directly to any third party (rather than by having them access the information through the Quantcast website), you must ensure that they agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of this Agreement including the foregoing requirements.</li></ol><p><strong>4.     Tagging Rules and Privacy. </strong></p><p>You agree not to misrepresent your digital traffic, audience, or user activity in connection with Quantcast, the Services, or any Tags. You agree not to tag any adware or spyware inventory, or any Reachpoint revealing precise geographic location (i.e., information that describes the precise location of a device derived through any technology that is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an individual or device), specific health / medical /sex-life information, credit card or financial data, or criminal convictions or charges. In addition, you agree not to tag any Reachpoint revealing data regarded as &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; or &ldquo;special category&rdquo; Personal Information under Applicable Privacy Laws, including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or health. You further agree not to tag any website that contains information about health conditions or treatments or that might otherwise reveal or suggest an individual&rsquo;s health status or treatment. If you represent to Quantcast (e.g., during the signup process) that your Reachpoints are directed to users under the age of 16, Quantcast will not collect any Personal Information from such Reachpoints and you will not receive those of our services that require collection of data across different websites. You will not modify the Tag other than as described in a <a href="https://help.quantcast.com/hc/en-us"><u>Quantcast Learning Center Guide</u></a>. You agree to update your Tag (which may require retagging your Reachpoints) when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades. You will use the Tag in the top most frame possible. You will retain the Tag&rsquo;s origin address that we provided, in full.</p><p>You agree to comply with Applicable Privacy Laws and also industry self-regulation Principles and Codes of Conduct for interest-based advertising in connection with your use of the Tag and the Services. You agree not to use the Services to track or collect personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can be used to contact or identify a particular individual, including name, address, telephone number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier) of end users. To the extent that the web pages or apps in which you place the Technology are accessed by end users located in Europe, you agree to implement a transparency and consent solution compatible with the <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/tcf"><u>IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework</u></a> or another solution mutually agreed by both parties in writing. While you are implementing such consent solution, you agree to (i) obtain consent for Quantcast to use cookies and similar technologies in compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws, (ii) provide proof of such consent if requested by Quantcast, and (iii) not permit calls from your web pages or apps to Quantcast servers if such consent has not be obtained. You agree to name Quantcast as a party for or by whom cookies or similar technologies are used to access the device and Personal Information is collected through your webpages or apps.</p><p>You further agree to prominently display to end users a user friendly, easily accessible, clear and comprehensive privacy policy (and, if necessitated by Applicable Privacy Laws, a separate cookie policy) that, where required, complies with Applicable Privacy Laws and contains the following (a) a statement that your site or app permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the types of data collected for such advertising, (iii) an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by, or transferred to, third parties, and (iv) a conspicuous link to either an opt-out mechanism, such as the NAI or DAA opt-outs for companies established outside of Europe or a consent revocation page for companies established in Europe. If you use the Services to collect data from a network of domains or subdomains, you will inform each in advance of such disclosures.</p><p>In the case of app measurement, operating system platforms provide device-level setting options that allow end users to indicate their preference with respect to third party data collection and targeted advertising (the <strong>&ldquo;<em>Ad Preference Setting</em>&rdquo;</strong>). Quantcast treats these device level Ad Preference Settings as consumer opt-outs and you will accurately pass the Ad Preference Setting to Quantcast. You will not send any identifier associated with a device to the extent that such device has otherwise indicated that the end user wishes to be opted out of advertisement tracking.</p><p>Unless agreed otherwise, you and Quantcast are each separate and independent Businesses or Controllers of any Personal Information which you and we may disclose or receive under this Agreement. You and Quantcast, pursuant to this Agreement, do not and will not jointly determine the purposes or the means of Processing of any Personal Information disclosed or received under this Agreement. Each party shall comply with the obligations that apply to it under Applicable Privacy Laws and provide Personal Information Processed pursuant to this Agreement the level of privacy protection required by such laws. In the event that either party determines that it can no longer meet its privacy obligations under this Agreement or the Privacy Laws, it shall inform the other party without undue delay.</p><p>If you are a Business subject to CCPA, you agree to prominently post a &ldquo;Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information&rdquo; link on all of your Reachpoints, and to provide consumers with the disclosures required of Businesses by CCPA.</p><div><br /></div><div><strong>5.     Restrictions.</strong></div><p>You agree to use the Services only in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You will not use the Services to engage in any illegal or offensive acts or serve any illegal content via any Reachpoint. You will not:</p><ol><li>Interfere or attempt to interfere with the operation or security-related features of the Services or the Technology;</li><li>Delete, or in any manner alter, the copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices appearing on any Quantcast Content;</li><li>Represent that Quantcast endorses or supports your services; make any representations and warranties concerning any aspect of the Services, the Technology, or Measurement Results to any Authorized Third Parties or other third parties; or</li><li>Attempt to index, scrape, search, or crawl the Services or the Quantcast website with any automated process; or attempt to access any information or technology relating to the Services, the Quantcast website, or our proprietary algorithms through any means not intentionally made available by Quantcast to you.<strong> </strong></li></ol><div><strong>6.     Quantcast Rights.</strong></div><p>All right, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Quantcast website, the Services, the Technology, and the Quantcast Content are and will remain the exclusive property of Quantcast (<strong>&ldquo;<em>Quantcast Property</em>&rdquo;</strong>). Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, you will not reproduce, modify, or prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or use such Quantcast Property. In the event that your Quantcast account is suspended or terminated, Quantcast will continue to respect this Agreement&rsquo;s limits on our use of the Measurement Data and will cease all public display of the Measurement Results.</p><p>Quantcast servers may choose to occasionally respond to any publisher&rsquo;s Tag by redirecting the browser to a third-party anonymous beacon to support the provision of Quantcast services in market. The decision to beacon is not related to you, your traffic, or your user base.</p><div><br /></div><div><strong>7.     Indemnity.</strong></div><p>Quantcast agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) resulting from a third-party claim that the Technology or the Services infringe any U.S. or European intellectual property rights, provided that you (i) promptly inform and furnish Quantcast with a copy of each related communication and action, (ii) allow Quantcast to assume full control of the defense and settlement, and (iii) assist and cooperate with Quantcast, at Quantcast&rsquo;s expense. Quantcast will have no obligation or liability hereunder where the claim results from any combination with, addition to, or modification of the Services or the Technology, from your failure to update your Tag, from your or any Authorized Affiliate breach of this Agreement, or from failure to obtain consent for your and our use of cookies or other tracking technology in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws. If the Services or Technology become, or, in Quantcast&rsquo;s opinion are likely to become, the subject of a third-party claim against you, Quantcast may, at its option and expense, procure rights for you to continue using the Services or the Technology, replace or modify the same so that it performs substantially similar functions but does not infringe, or terminate this Agreement. <strong>The foregoing states the sole and exclusive liability of Quantcast and your sole remedy with respect to third party claims of any kind.</strong></p><p>You agree to indemnify and hold Quantcast harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) resulting from a third-party claim resulting from your failure to update your Tag when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades.</p><div><br /></div><div><strong>8.     Warranty Disclaimer.</strong></div><p><strong>The services and related information are provided &ldquo;as is,&rdquo; without warranty or condition of any kind, either express or implied.

No information, whether oral or written, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein. The foregoing exclusions and disclaimers are an essential part of this Agreement and formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer the Services to you. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain warranties so this disclaimer may not apply to you in full.</strong></p><div><br /></div><div><strong>9.     Suspension and Termination.</strong></div><p>Unless otherwise terminated as set forth herein, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services.

Quantcast may also modify this Agreement from time to time. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable to you, you may terminate your account within 30 days by following the two-step procedure described in Section 9.

Limitation of Liability.</strong></div><p><strong>In no event will Quantcast be liable to you or any third party for any consequential loss, exemplary damages, incidental loss, special damages or loss, lost profit, loss or deletion of Measurement Data or Measurement Results, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Services, even if Quantcast has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer these Services to you. This paragraph will apply regardless of any failure of the exclusive remedy provided in the following paragraph.</strong></p><p>Except with regard to Quantcast&rsquo;s obligations under Section 7, liability stemming from death or personal injury resulting from Quantcast&rsquo;s negligence, or Quantcast&rsquo;s fraud, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Quantcast&rsquo;s liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to two hundred fifty U.S. dollars (US$250.00).</p><div><br /></div><div><strong>12.

QUANTCAST MAY MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME; CONTINUED USE 30 DAYS AFTER NOTIFICATION WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE (SEE SECTION 10).</p><p>Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in Section 14.</p><p>This Agreement incorporates the <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/legal/us-data-privacy-addendum/"><u>US State Data Privacy Addendum</u></a> to the extent that the Services include processing personal information that is subject to U.S. State Privacy Laws (as defined in the foregoing Addendum) and the <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/legal/publisher-partner-privacy-implementation/"><u>Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Publisher Partners</u></a>.</p><ol><li><strong> Introduction: Reachpoints, Tags, and Measurement Data.</strong></li></ol><p>Quantcast Measure is a free digital audience measurement service that allows you to tag web pages, video, advertisements, apps, content, and paid search campaigns (what we call, <strong>&ldquo;<em>Reachpoints</em>&rdquo;) </strong>for direct measurement.</p><p>You can also define and measure actions and events by customizing your Tags with labels. You have complete control over (and are solely responsible for) which Reachpoints are tagged, how segments are labelled (e.g., with meaningful or obfuscated names), and how the resulting Measurement Results are or are not disclosed publicly.</p><p>Each time a browser visits your tagged Reachpoints, Quantcast may, in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws, collect traffic statistics like those in any web server log (what we call, <strong>&ldquo;<em>Measurement Data</em>&rdquo;</strong>). We then apply proprietary Quantcast algorithms and other data to the Measurement Data to generate the <strong>&ldquo;<em>Measurement Results</em>&rdquo;, </strong>which we make available to you on the Quantcast website (see Section 3).</p><p>To measure Reachpoints that you do not own or control, you may provide your Tag to a third party who accepts this Agreement (any such third party, an <strong><em>&ldquo;Authorized Affiliate&rdquo;</em></strong>); you may also instruct us to give the Authorized Affiliate access to the Measurement Results.</p><ol><li><strong> Registration.</strong></li></ol><p>In order to access the Services you must register for a Quantcast account on the Quantcast website. Each new app you Tag requires its own registration and then receives its own unique API key. In registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information, and to keep it up to date. Any processing of Personal Information when registering for a Quantcast account will be processed in accordance with the Quantcast Website and Corporate Privacy Policy which you can access <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/legal/privacy-website/"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p>You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. You hereby take responsibility for all actions taken&mdash;and instructions provided to Quantcast&mdash;under your account or with the Measurement Results, by you or any third parties, whether or not authorized. You will notify Quantcast immediately of any unauthorized or non-compliant use of your account and will cooperate with us in stopping it.</p><ol><li><strong> Measurement Data and Results.</strong></li></ol><p>Quantcast uses each piece of Measurement Data both to understand your audience (for your benefit only) and as one of trillions of data points for predictive analytics and in determining what content and advertising to show individuals across the internet and other digital applications. You acknowledge that Quantcast may use Personal Information it receives from you to provide services to other Quantcast clients or for Quantcast&rsquo;s commercial interests that may be unrelated to providing the Services to you.</p><p>Quantcast will never sell your audience (whether identified as such or not) and you control the extent to which Quantcast displays the Measurement Results.</p><p>Quantcast grants you perpetual rights to use, copy, and distribute the Measurement Results, including with our sharable widgets, only as long as you:</p><ol><li>Credit Us. Conspicuously include: &ldquo;Source: Quantcast <a href="https://www.quantcast.com/"><u>www.quantcast.com</u></a>&rdquo;;</li><li>Present the Measurement Results Exactly as We Provided It. Do not: (i) manipulate or modify the Measurement Results to state or suggest different results from those specifically presented by Quantcast; (ii) combine information related to different Quantcast profiles (for example, by adding together the reach from two different sites instead of presenting the cross-site unduplicated reach measurement provided by Quantcast); (iii) quantitatively aggregate or combine information in the Measurement Results with information derived from other sources (but offering a comparison with information derived from other sources is permissible);</li><li>Don&rsquo;t Use Our Work to Compete with Us. Do not use the information in the Measurement Results in any way that competes with Quantcast; and</li><li>Bind Third Parties. If you provide the information in the Measurement Results directly to any third party (rather than by having them access the information through the Quantcast website), you must ensure that they agree to be bound by and comply with the terms of this Agreement including the foregoing requirements.</li><li><strong> Tagging Rules and Privacy.</strong></li></ol><p>You agree not to misrepresent your digital traffic, audience, or user activity in connection with Quantcast, the Services, or any Tags. You agree not to tag any adware or spyware inventory, or any Reachpoint revealing precise geographic location (i.e., information that describes the precise location of a device derived through any technology that is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an individual or device), specific health / medical /sex-life information, credit card or financial data, or criminal convictions or charges. In addition, you agree not to tag any Reachpoint revealing data regarded as &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; or &ldquo;special category&rdquo; Personal Information under Applicable Privacy Laws, including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or health. If you represent to Quantcast (e.g., during the signup process) that your Reachpoints are directed to users under the age of 16, Quantcast will not collect any Personal Information from such Reachpoints and you will not receive those of our services that require collection of data across different websites. You will not modify the Tag other than as described in a <a href="https://help.quantcast.com/hc/en-us"><u>Quantcast Learning Center Guide</u></a>. You agree to update your Tag (which may require retagging your Reachpoints) when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades. You will use the Tag in the top most frame possible. You will retain the Tag&rsquo;s origin address that we provided, in full.</p><p>You agree to comply with Applicable Privacy Laws and also industry self-regulation Principles and Codes of Conduct for interest-based advertising in connection with your use of the Tag and the Services. You agree not to use the Services to track or collect personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can be used to contact or identify a particular individual, including name, address, telephone number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier) of end users. To the extent that the web pages or apps in which you place the Technology are accessed by end users located in Europe, you agree to implement a transparency and consent solution compatible with the <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/tcf"><u>IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework</u></a> or another solution mutually agreed by both parties in writing. While you are implementing such consent solution, you agree to (i) obtain consent for Quantcast to use cookies and similar technologies in compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws, (ii) provide proof of such consent if requested by Quantcast, and (iii) not permit calls from your web pages or apps to Quantcast servers if such consent has not be obtained. You agree to name Quantcast as a party for or by whom cookies or similar technologies are used to access the device and Personal Information is collected through your webpages or apps.</p><p>You further agree to prominently display to end users a user friendly, easily accessible, clear and comprehensive privacy policy (and, if necessitated by Applicable Privacy Laws, a separate cookie policy) that, where required, complies with Applicable Privacy Laws and contains the following (a) a statement that your site or app permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the types of data collected for such advertising, (iii) an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by, or transferred to, third parties, and (iv) a conspicuous link to either an opt-out mechanism, such as the NAI or DAA opt-outs for companies established outside of Europe or a consent revocation page for companies established in Europe. If you use the Services to collect data from a network of domains or subdomains, you will inform each in advance of such disclosures.</p><p>In the case of app measurement, operating system platforms provide device-level setting options that allow end users to indicate their preference with respect to third party data collection and targeted advertising (the <strong>&ldquo;<em>Ad Preference Setting</em>&rdquo;</strong>). Quantcast treats these device level Ad Preference Settings as consumer opt-outs and you will accurately pass the Ad Preference Setting to Quantcast. You will not send any identifier associated with a device to the extent that such device has otherwise indicated that the end user wishes to be opted out of advertisement tracking.</p><p>Unless agreed otherwise, you and Quantcast are each separate and independent Businesses or Controllers of any Personal Information which you and we may disclose or receive under this Agreement. You and Quantcast, pursuant to this Agreement, do not and will not jointly determine the purposes or the means of Processing of any Personal Information disclosed or received under this Agreement. Each party shall comply with the obligations that apply to it under Applicable Privacy Laws and provide Personal Information Processed pursuant to this Agreement the level of privacy protection required by such laws. In the event that either party determines that it can no longer meet its privacy obligations under this Agreement or the Privacy Laws, it shall inform the other party without undue delay.</p><p>If you are a Business subject to CCPA, you agree to prominently post a &ldquo;Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information&rdquo; link on all of your Reachpoints, and to provide consumers with the disclosures required of Businesses by CCPA.</p><ol><li><strong> Restrictions.</strong></li></ol><p>You agree to use the Services only in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. You will not use the Services to engage in any illegal or offensive acts or serve any illegal content via any Reachpoint. You will not:</p><ol><li>Interfere or attempt to interfere with the operation or security-related features of the Services or the Technology;</li><li>Delete, or in any manner alter, the copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices appearing on any Quantcast Content;</li><li>Represent that Quantcast endorses or supports your services; make any representations and warranties concerning any aspect of the Services, the Technology, or Measurement Results to any Authorized Third Parties or other third parties; or</li><li>Attempt to index, scrape, search, or crawl the Services or the Quantcast website with any automated process; or attempt to access any information or technology relating to the Services, the Quantcast website, or our proprietary algorithms through any means not intentionally made available by Quantcast to you.</li><li><strong> Quantcast Rights.</strong></li></ol><p>All right, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Quantcast website, the Services, the Technology, and the Quantcast Content are and will remain the exclusive property of Quantcast (<strong>&ldquo;<em>Quantcast Property</em>&rdquo;</strong>). Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, you will not reproduce, modify, or prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or use such Quantcast Property. In the event that your Quantcast account is suspended or terminated, Quantcast will continue to respect this Agreement&rsquo;s limits on our use of the Measurement Data and will cease all public display of the Measurement Results.</p><p>Quantcast servers may choose to occasionally respond to any publisher&rsquo;s Tag by redirecting the browser to a third-party anonymous beacon to support the provision of Quantcast services in market. The decision to beacon is not related to you, your traffic, or your user base.</p><ol><li><strong> Indemnity.</strong></li></ol><p>Quantcast agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold you harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) resulting from a third-party claim that the Technology or the Services infringe any U.S. or European intellectual property rights, provided that you (i) promptly inform and furnish Quantcast with a copy of each related communication and action, (ii) allow Quantcast to assume full control of the defense and settlement, and (iii) assist and cooperate with Quantcast, at Quantcast&rsquo;s expense. Quantcast will have no obligation or liability hereunder where the claim results from any combination with, addition to, or modification of the Services or the Technology, from your failure to update your Tag, from your or any Authorized Affiliate breach of this Agreement, or from failure to obtain consent for your and our use of cookies or other tracking technology in accordance with Applicable Privacy Laws. If the Services or Technology become, or, in Quantcast&rsquo;s opinion are likely to become, the subject of a third-party claim against you, Quantcast may, at its option and expense, procure rights for you to continue using the Services or the Technology, replace or modify the same so that it performs substantially similar functions but does not infringe, or terminate this Agreement. <strong>The foregoing states the sole and exclusive liability of Quantcast and your sole remedy with respect to third party claims of any kind.</strong></p><p>You agree to indemnify and hold Quantcast harmless from any judgments, damages, loss, liability, or costs (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees) resulting from a third-party claim resulting from your failure to update your Tag when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades.</p><ol><li><strong> Warranty Disclaimer.</strong></li></ol><p><strong>The services and related information are provided &ldquo;as is,&rdquo; without warranty or condition of any kind, either express or implied.

No information, whether oral or written, will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein. The foregoing exclusions and disclaimers are an essential part of this Agreement and formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer the Services to you. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion of certain warranties so this disclaimer may not apply to you in full.</strong></p><ol><li><strong> Suspension and Termination.</strong></li></ol><p>Unless otherwise terminated as set forth herein, this Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. You may terminate your Quantcast account and this Agreement at any time by both (i) &ldquo;dequantifying&rdquo; by deleting all Reachpoints from your profile on the Quantcast website (or, alternatively, by emailing contact@quantcast.com (if you are resident in the US) or contact.dublin@quantcast.com (if you are resident outside the US) with your complete account information and explicit request to terminate) and (ii) removing the Tags from all of your Reachpoints. Quantcast may terminate or suspend your access to the Services or terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or no reason and without any liability to you. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you under this Agreement will immediately cease. Quantcast will not be liable to you or any third party for termination of this Agreement (whether by Quantcast or by you) or any termination or suspension of your use of the Services. Upon any termination or suspension, information in connection with your account may no longer be accessed by you. Notwithstanding the above, Sections 4 through 9, Sections 11 through 13, and the second paragraph of Section 3 will survive termination.</p><ol><li><strong> Modification of the Service and of the Terms.</strong></li></ol><p>Quantcast reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or discontinue the Quantcast website and Services without notice. Quantcast may also modify this Agreement from time to time. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable to you, you may terminate your account within 30 days by following the two-step procedure described in Section 9. Use of the Quantcast website, use of any Tag to contact Quantcast&rsquo;s servers, or use of the Services will constitute your acceptance thereof.</p><ol><li><strong> Limitation of Liability.</strong></li></ol><p><strong>In no event will Quantcast be liable to you or any third party for any consequential loss, exemplary damages, incidental loss, special damages or loss, lost profit, loss or deletion of Measurement Data or Measurement Results, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Services, even if Quantcast has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations formed a basis for enabling Quantcast to offer these Services to you. This paragraph will apply regardless of any failure of the exclusive remedy provided in the following paragraph.</strong></p><p>Except with regard to Quantcast&rsquo;s obligations under Section 7, liability stemming from death or personal injury resulting from Quantcast&rsquo;s negligence, or Quantcast&rsquo;s fraud, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Quantcast&rsquo;s liability to you for any cause whatsoever and regardless of the form of the action, will at all times be limited to two hundred fifty U.S. dollars (US$250.00).</p><ol><li><strong> Miscellaneous.</strong></li></ol><p>This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties with respect to the Services and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, and communications, written or oral between Quantcast and you with respect thereto. Any agreements regarding the delivery or use of advertising segments will govern the parties&rsquo; relationship in connection with the applicable segments but will not affect the parties&rsquo; rights, restrictions, or obligations under this Agreement, which the parties acknowledge as separate subject matter. Any waiver by either party of any violation of this Agreement will not be deemed to waive any further or future violation of the same or any other provision.

You agree not to tag any adware or spyware inventory, or any Reachpoint revealing precise geographic location (i.e., information that describes the precise location of a device derived through any technology that is capable of determining with reasonable specificity the actual physical location of an individual or device), specific health / medical /sex-life information, credit card or financial data, or criminal convictions or charges. In addition, if you are an EU established company or person or your Reachpoints are directed towards end users in the EU, you agree not to tag any Reachpoint revealing other sensitive or special category Personal Data, including racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership. If you represent to Quantcast (e.g., during the signup process) that your Reachpoints are directed to users under the age of 16, Quantcast will not collect any Personal Data from such Reachpoints and you will not receive those of our services that require collection of data across different websites. You will not modify the Tag other than as described in a <a href="https://help.quantcast.com/hc/en-us"><u>Quantcast Learning Center Guide</u></a>. You agree to update your Tag (which may require retagging your Reachpoints) when we notify you of any Tag fixes, updates or upgrades. You will use the Tag in the top most frame possible. You will retain the Tag&rsquo;s origin address that we provided, in full.</p><p>You agree to comply with Applicable Privacy Laws and also industry self-regulation Principles and Codes of Conduct for interest-based advertising in connection with your use of the Tag and the Services. You agree not to use the Services to track or collect personally identifiable information of end users.

While you are implementing such consent solution, you agree to (i) obtain consent for Quantcast to use cookies and similar technologies in compliance with Applicable Privacy Laws, (ii) provide proof of such consent if requested by Quantcast, and (iii) not permit calls from your web pages or apps to Quantcast servers if such consent has not be obtained. Wherever possible, you agree to name Quantcast as a party for or by whom cookies or similar technologies are used to access the device and Personal Data is collected through your webpages or apps.</p><p>You further agree to prominently display to end users a user friendly, easily accessible, clear and comprehensive privacy policy (and, if necessitated by Applicable Privacy Laws, a separate cookie policy) that, where required, complies with Applicable Privacy Laws and contains the following (a) a statement that your site or app permits data collection for interest-based advertising, (ii) a description of the types of data collected for such advertising, (iii) an explanation of the purposes for which data is collected by, or transferred to, third parties, and (iv) a conspicuous link to either an opt-out mechanism, such as the NAI or DAA opt-outs for non-EU established companies or a consent revocation page for EU established companies. If you use the Services to collect data from a network of domains or subdomains, you will inform each in advance of such disclosures.</p><p>In the case of app measurement, operating system platforms provide device-level setting options that allow end users to indicate their preference with respect to third party data collection and targeted advertising (the &ldquo;<strong><em>Ad Preference Setting</em></strong>&rdquo;). Quantcast treats these device level Ad Preference Settings as consumer opt-outs and you will accurately pass the Ad Preference Setting to Quantcast. You will not send any identifier associated with a device to the extent that such device has otherwise indicated that the end user wishes to be opted out of advertisement tracking.</p><p>To the extent that GDPR applies, you and Quantcast are each separate and independent data controllers of any Personal Data which you and we may disclose or receive under this Agreement.

These Key Terms are for use in understanding the Quantcast Products and Services Privacy Policy. Nothing in these Key Terms modifies any active agreement with any Quantcast customer, vendor or other business partner (e.g., agreements for the Advertise and Measure product, etc.).</p><h3><a id="_30j0zll"></a>Advertising Exchange</h3><p>See <a href="#_44sinio"><u>Exchange/Advertising Exchange</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_1fob9te"></a>Attributes/Attribute Information</h3><p>Attributes are known, observed, or inferred characteristics. Examples of attributes are &ldquo;male&rdquo; and &ldquo;visited XYZ website&rdquo;. Attributes may be derived from <a href="#_1ksv4uv"><u>Event Data</u></a>, <a href="#_tyjcwt"><u>Bid Request Data</u></a>, <a href="#_1t3h5sf"><u>Client Data</u></a>,<a href="#_nmf14n"><u> Third Party Data</u></a>, and <a href="#_qsh70q"><u>Inferences/Inferred Data</u></a>. Quantcast associates attributes with <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_3znysh7"></a>Audience</h3><p>An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an <a href="#_3as4poj"><u>Interest</u></a>, such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an <a href="#_1fob9te"><u>Attribute</u></a>, such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Quantcast Client&rsquo;s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Quantcast Client&rsquo;s advertisement.</p><h3><a id="_2et92p0"></a>Audience Insights</h3><p>Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an <a href="#_3znysh7"><u>Audience</u></a>. Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not <a href="#_32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a>. An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.</p><p>Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on <a href="#_1ksv4uv"><u>Event Data</u></a>, <a href="#_tyjcwt"><u>Bid Request Data</u></a>, <a href="#_1t3h5sf"><u>Client Data</u></a>, <a href="#_nmf14n"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>, and <a href="#_qsh70q"><u>Inferred Data</u></a> to Quantcast Clients. Audience Insights enable Quantcast Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.</p><h3><a id="_tyjcwt"></a>Bid Request/Bid Request Data</h3><p>A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher&rsquo;s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and an ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an <a href="#_30j0zll"><u>Advertising Exchange</u></a>. This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the publisher&rsquo;s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard (<a href="https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/"><u>https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/</u></a>), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of one or more <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>s (if available), the content that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app, video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (e.g.., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as <a href="#_1y810tw"><u>TCF Signals</u></a>. Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast&rsquo;s response to the Bid Request, such as whether a Quantcast Client bid on the ad opportunity.</p><h3><a id="_3dy6vkm"></a>Browsing Data</h3><p>Browsing Data is information collected relating to your <a href="#_147n2zr"><u>Online</u></a> activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a <a href="#_1hmsyys"><u>Pixels, Tags, or SDKs</u></a> installed by a Quantcast Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website <a href="#_1mrcu09"><u>URL</u></a> of the page you are visiting, often along with a <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>, as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from <a href="#_z337ya"><u>HTTP Header Information</u></a>, such as referral <a href="#_1mrcu09"><u>URLs </u></a>(which is the <a href="#_1mrcu09"><u>URL </u></a>that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).</p><p>Browsing Data is included in <a href="#_1ksv4uv"><u>Event Data</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_1t3h5sf"></a>Client Data</h3><p>Client Data is <a href="#_4i7ojhp"><u>Imported Data</u></a> that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular Quantcast advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is <a href="#_3fwokq0"><u>Pseudonymised Information,</u></a> which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users&rsquo; <a href="#_147n2zr"><u>Online Data</u></a> or <a href="#_23ckvvd"><u>Offline Data</u></a>, or other characteristics or aspects of users&rsquo; relationship with the Quantcast Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right <a href="#_3znysh7"><u>Audiences</u></a> and assess their effectiveness, all on behalf of the Quantcast Client.</p><h3><a id="_4d34og8"></a>Cookie</h3><p>A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Quantcast Clients&rsquo; advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are <a href="#_3fwokq0"><u>Pseudonymous Information</u></a>; in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a<a href="#_vx1227"><u> Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> or <a href="#_3fwokq0"><u>Pseudonymous Information</u></a> from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.</p><p>There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.</p><p>A &ldquo;First Party Cookie&rdquo; is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (&ldquo;First Party Cookie&rdquo;). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If <a href="http://www.example.com"><u>www.example.com</u></a> incorporates Quantcast <a href="#_1hmsyys"><u>Pixels, Tags or SDKs</u></a> into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store a <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> in the context of your visits to that site.</p><p>A &ldquo;Third Party Cookie&rdquo; is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting <a href="http://www.example.com"><u>www.example.com</u></a> and a Quantcast <a href="#_1hmsyys"><u>Pixel, Tag or SDK </u></a>on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast <a href="#_1hmsyys"><u>Pixels, Tags or SDKs</u></a>. Quantcast uses</p><p><a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.</p><p>Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy &ldquo;Information Collection&rdquo; section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy &ldquo;Information Collection&rdquo; section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.</p><h3><a id="_2s8eyo1"></a>Cookie ID/Identifier</h3><p>A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a <a href="#_4d34og8"><u>Cookie</u></a> that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a>. A <a href="#_2jxsxqh"><u>First Party Cookie</u></a> ID is a unique <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> relating to the <a href="#_2jxsxqh"><u>First-Party Cookie</u></a> set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A <a href="#_28h4qwu"><u>Third Party Cookie ID</u></a> is a unique<a href="#_vx1227"><u> Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> relating to the <a href="#_28h4qwu"><u>Third-Party Cookie</u></a> set by Quantcast.</p><h3><a id="_17dp8vu"></a>Cookie Syncing/Matching</h3><p>In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier </u></a>can determine which of their respective <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as &ldquo;cookie ID 123.&rdquo; Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as &ldquo;cookie ID ABC.&rdquo; Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous identifiers </u></a>may relate to the device that Quantcast records as &ldquo;cookie ID 123&rdquo;.</p><p>Quantcast&rsquo;s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates <a href="#_1hmsyys"><u>Pixels, Tags or SDKs</u></a> from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast<a href="#_vx1227"><u> Pseudonymous Identifiers </u></a>(this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B). Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast&rsquo;s <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>.</p><p>The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing <a href="#_1fob9te"><u>Attributes</u></a> related to Quantcast <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers </u></a>with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier.</u></a></p><h3><a id="_3rdcrjn"></a>Cross-Media Matching/Linking</h3><p>In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user&rsquo;s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or <a href="#_qsh70q"><u>Inferred </u></a>to relate to the same user. Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.</p><p>If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is&ldquo;probabilistic&rdquo;&ndash; in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.</p><h3><a id="_26in1rg"></a>Data Management Platforms and Data Providers</h3><p>Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide <a href="#_nmf14n"><u>Third Party Data</u></a> to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can provide <a href="#_1t3h5sf"><u>Client Data</u></a> to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party <a href="#_3znysh7"><u>Audience</u></a> <a href="#_1v1yuxt"><u>Segment Data</u></a> from different sources (such as <a href="#_147n2zr"><u>Online Data</u></a> and <a href="#_23ckvvd"><u>Offline Data</u></a>) to businesses or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast&rsquo;s use in connection with the Solutions. We share <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> with <a href="#_26in1rg"><u>Data Management Platforms/Data Providers</u></a> in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see <a href="#_17dp8vu"><u>Cookie Syncing/Matching</u></a>).</p><h3><a id="_lnxbz9"></a>Device ID/Identifier</h3><p>A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device&rsquo;s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or &ldquo;Device IDs&rdquo;) serve a similar purpose as <a href="#_4d34og8"><u>Cookies</u></a> and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>.</p><p>A Mobile Advertising ID (or &ldquo;MAID&rdquo;) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device or connected TV (&ldquo;CTV&rdquo;) device by the device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device&rsquo;s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.</p><h3><a id="_35nkun2"></a>Device Configuration/Device Information</h3><p>Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>. The information includes device type and version, screen size and resolution, browser language, device operating system and version, browser type and version, application and version, or other information about the device. Some Device Information is derived from <a href="#_z337ya"><u>HTTP Request Header Information</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_eimewhwtlkbq"></a>Email Address</h3><p>See Hashed Email Address</p><h3><a id="_1ksv4uv"></a>Event Data</h3><p>Information collected relating to your <a href="#_147n2zr"><u>Online</u></a> activity/behaviour, which may include<a href="#_32hioqz"><u> Personal Information</u></a> in <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a>, <a href="#_3whwml4"><u>Imprecise/Approximate Location Information</u></a>, <a href="#_z337ya"><u>HTTP Request Header Information</u></a>, <a href="#_35nkun2"><u>Device Information</u></a>, <a href="#_3dy6vkm"><u>Browsing Data</u></a> and <a href="#_46r0co2"><u>TCF Signals</u></a>. Event Data is generated when a <a href="#_1hmsyys"><u>Pixel, Tag, or SDK</u></a> installed on a Quantcast Client&rsquo;s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a <a href="#_2u6wntf"><u>Tag</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_44sinio"></a>Exchange/Advertising Exchange</h3><p>A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives <a href="#_tyjcwt"><u>Bid Requests</u></a> from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to <a href="#_tyjcwt"><u>Bid Requests</u></a> with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.</p><h3><a id="_2jxsxqh"></a>First Party Cookie</h3><p>See <a href="#_4d34og8"><u>Cookie</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_n4w09y2ozw7i"></a>Hashed Email Address</h3><p>A hashed email address (HEM) is an email address that has been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function. A hashed email is treated as a <a href="#_n270so602c2d"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_z337ya"></a>HTTP Request Header Information</h3><p>HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a <a href="#_1hmsyys"><u>Pixel</u></a> loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a <a href="#_tyjcwt"><u>Bid Request</u></a>. We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:</p><ul><li><a href="#_1pxezwc"><u>IP Address</u></a></li><li><a href="#_4d34og8"><u>Cookie</u></a> (if available)</li><li>User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) that includes <a href="#_35nkun2"><u>Device Information</u></a>.</li><li>Date, which includes the precise time of access</li><li>Referral <a href="#_1mrcu09"><u>URL</u></a>, which is the web page you were on when the request was sent</li><li>TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server</li><li>Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content</li></ul><p>Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for &ldquo;HTTP header information fields&rdquo;.</p><h3><a id="_1y810tw"></a>IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (&ldquo;TCF&rdquo;)</h3><p>The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or &ldquo;TCF,&rdquo; is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Processing</u></a> by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Processing</u></a>.</p><p>The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.</p><p>The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:</p><p>(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Processing </u></a>of <a href="#_32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a>, the specific purposes for which Quantcast <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Processes </u></a><a href="#_32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a>, and Quantcast's legal basis for such <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Processing</u></a>, directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;</p><p>(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of <a href="#_4d34og8"><u>Cookies</u></a>, and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Processing</u></a>, which are the reasons why Quantcast <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Processes </u></a>the personal data of users (&ldquo;<a href="#_3tbugp1"><u>TCF Purposes&rdquo;</u></a>), including where Quantcast relies on the user&rsquo;s consent for such <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Processing </u></a>directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;</p><p>(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Processing </u></a>of <a href="#_32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a> (for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.</p><p>Using the <a href="#_19c6y18"><u>TCF </u></a>allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast&rsquo;s <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Processing </u></a>to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the <a href="#_19c6y18"><u>TCF's </u></a>&ldquo;<a href="https://iabeurope.eu/vendor-list-tcf-v2-0/"><u>Global Vendor List</u></a>&rdquo;, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast&rsquo;s Privacy Policy <a href="#_1mrcu09"><u>URL</u></a>, the purposes for which it <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Processes</u></a> <a href="#_32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a>, and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.</p><p>In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast&rsquo;s transparency disclosures were provided to a user; (B) whether or not the user has consented to Quantcast&rsquo;s <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Processing </u></a>and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast&rsquo;s <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Processing </u></a>and/or any purposes for which Quantcast <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Processes </u></a><a href="#_32hioqz"><u>Personal Information </u></a>on the basis of its legitimate interests (the &ldquo;TCF Signal&rdquo;).</p><p>TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast <a href="#_2u6wntf"><u>Tags</u></a> if the digital property on which the <a href="#_2u6wntf"><u>Tag </u></a>is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (&ldquo;CMP&rdquo;) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the <a href="#_tyjcwt"><u>Bid Requests</u></a> it receives from <a href="#_2lwamvv"><u>Advertising Exchanges</u></a>. Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Process </u></a><a href="#_32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a> for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.</p><p>Read more about the TCF here <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/"><u>https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/</u></a></p><h3><a id="_4i7ojhp"></a>Imported Data</h3><p>Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (&ldquo;API&rdquo;). Imported Data is <a href="#_3fwokq0"><u>Pseudonymised Information</u></a>, which may include information relating to your <a href="#_147n2zr"><u>Online data</u></a> or <a href="#_23ckvvd"><u>Offline data</u></a> or other information that Quantcast Clients or partners have about you. For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see <a href="#_1t3h5sf"><u>Client Data</u></a> or <a href="#_nmf14n"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_2xcytpi"></a>Imported Data (Client)</h3><p>See <a href="#_1t3h5sf"><u>Client Data</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_1ci93xb"></a>Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)</h3><p>See <a href="#_nmf14n"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_3whwml4"></a>Imprecise/Approximate Location Information</h3><p>Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.</p><p>Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one meter. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Quantcast Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.</p><p>Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from <a href="#_1pxezwc"><u>IP Addresses</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_qsh70q"></a>Inferences/Inferred Data</h3><p>Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as <a href="#_1ksv4uv"><u>Event Data</u></a>, <a href="#_tyjcwt"><u>Bid Request Data</u></a>,<a href="#_1t3h5sf"><u> Client Data</u></a>, or <a href="#_nmf14n"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>. Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> as part of a set of device <a href="#_1fob9te"><u>Attributes</u></a>.</p><p>For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider&rsquo;s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel. Other Inferences include things such as <a href="#_3as4poj"><u>Interests</u></a>, income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.</p><p>Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an <a href="#_3znysh7"><u>Audience</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_3as4poj"></a>Interests</h3><p>Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include &ldquo;cooking&rdquo; and &ldquo;outdoor activities&rdquo;. Interests may be derived from <a href="#_1ksv4uv"><u>Event Data</u></a>, <a href="#_tyjcwt"><u>Bid Request Data</u></a>, <a href="#_1t3h5sf"><u>Client Data</u></a>, <a href="#_nmf14n"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>, and <a href="#_qsh70q"><u>Inferences/Inferred Data</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_1pxezwc"></a>IP Address</h3><p>An IP (&ldquo;Internet Protocol&rdquo;) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device&rsquo;s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.</p><h3><a id="_49x2ik5"></a>Labels/Label Data</h3><p>Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a &ldquo;label&rdquo; to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as &ldquo;Work,&rdquo; family members as &ldquo;Family,&rdquo; and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.</p><p>Labels processed by Quantcast are:</p><ul><li>Labels from <a href="#_26in1rg"><u>Data Management Platforms and Data Providers</u></a> : these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>;</li><li>Custom-<a href="#_1t3h5sf"><u>Client Data</u></a> Labels: these are custom category labels set by Quantcast Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).</li><li><a href="#_qsh70q"><u>Inferred Data</u></a> Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>, e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.</li></ul><p>Example Labels are &ldquo;male&rdquo; and &ldquo;visited XYZ website&rdquo;. Labels may be inferred information (see <a href="#_qsh70q"><u>Inferences/Inferred Data</u></a>) or may be<a href="#_4i7ojhp"><u> Imported Data</u></a> (see <a href="#_1t3h5sf"><u>Client Data</u></a> and <a href="#_nmf14n"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>).</p><h3><a id="_2p2csry"></a>Log Data</h3><p>Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Processing</u></a>, we use more precise terms, such as <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a>, <a href="#_1ksv4uv"><u>Event Data</u></a>, <a href="#_tyjcwt"><u>Bid Request Data</u></a>, <a href="#_1t3h5sf"><u>Client Data</u></a>, <a href="#_nmf14n"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>, and/or <a href="#_qsh70q"><u>Inferences/Inferred Data</u></a>, which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term &ldquo;Log Data.&rdquo; Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a>, will not qualify as <a href="#_32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a>. For example, a single time zone and publisher <a href="#_1mrcu09"><u>URL</u></a> without an associated <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier </u></a>would not qualify as <a href="#_32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_147n2zr"></a>Online Data</h3><p>Data relating to a user&rsquo;s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.</p><h3><a id="_23ckvvd"></a>Offline Data</h3><p>Data relating to a user&rsquo;s real-world purchases and/or activity.</p><h3><a id="_ihv636"></a>Panel</h3><p>A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.</p><p>This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.</p><p>Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.</p><h3><a id="_32hioqz"></a>Personal Information</h3><p>Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as &ldquo;personal data.&rdquo;</p><p>The Personal Information <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Processed </u></a>by Quantcast is limited to <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymised Identifiers.</u></a> Quantcast does not <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Process</u></a> <a href="#_32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a> that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.</p><h3><a id="_1hmsyys"></a>Pixels, Tags, and SDKs</h3><p>Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website, mobile applications, and advertisements that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Quantcast Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive <a href="#_z337ya"><u>HTTP Header Information</u></a>, along with other information that is configured by the Quantcast Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.</p><p>Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:</p><ul><li>Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.</li><li>Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Quantcast Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.</li><li>Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients&rsquo; web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.</li><li>Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.</li><li>SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.</li></ul><h3><a id="_41mghml"></a>Probabilistic Identifier</h3><p>A Probabilistic Identifier is a<a href="#_vx1227"><u> Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> which we create by combining <a href="#_vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> (such as <a href="#_1pxezwc"><u>IP Addresses</u></a>) with <a href="#_tyjcwt"><u>Bid Request Data</u></a> and/or <a href="#_1ksv4uv"><u>Event Data</u></a> using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using <a href="#_2s8eyo1"><u>Cookie IDs</u></a>, this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.</p><h3><a id="_2grqrue"></a>Process</h3><p>Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon <a href="#_32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a> or sets of <a href="#_32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a>, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.</p><h3><a id="_n270so602c2d"></a>Pseudonymous Identifiers</h3><p>Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.</p><p>Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.</p><p>We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:</p><ul><li>Third Party Cookie ID: see <a href="#_2s8eyo1"><u>Cookie ID</u></a>.</li><li>First Party Cookie ID: see <a href="#_2s8eyo1"><u>Cookie ID</u></a>.</li><li><a href="#_1pxezwc"><u>IP Addresses</u></a>.</li><li><a href="#_n4w09y2ozw7i"><u>Hashed email addresses</u></a></li><li>Third party identifiers</li><li><a href="#_lnxbz9"><u>Device ID</u></a>.</li><li>Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.</li><li>Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).</li><li>Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a <a href="#_tyjcwt"><u>Bid Request</u></a> that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.</li><li><a href="#_41mghml"><u>Probabilistic Identifier</u></a>.</li><li>Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.</li><li>TLS Session ID: when you visit a website <a href="#_1mrcu09"><u>URL</u></a> that starts with &ldquo;https&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;http&rdquo;, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our <a href="#_1hmsyys"><u>Pixels, Tags or SDKs</u></a> loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.</li></ul><h3><a id="_3fwokq0"></a>Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information</h3><p>Pseudonymised Information is <a href="#_32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a> that has been <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Processed</u></a> in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.</p><h3><a id="_1v1yuxt"></a>Segment Data</h3><p>Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by <a href="#_1t3h5sf"><u>Clients</u></a> or <a href="#_nmf14n"><u>Third Party Data Partners</u></a>. Segment Data is <a href="#_3fwokq0"><u>Pseudonymised Information</u></a>, which may include <a href="#_147n2zr"><u>Online Data</u></a> and/or <a href="#_23ckvvd"><u>Offline Data</u></a> as well as <a href="#_1fob9te"><u>Attributes</u></a>, <a href="#_qsh70q"><u>Inferences</u></a>, or <a href="#_3as4poj"><u>Interests </u></a>inferred from that data. This category of information is typically called &ldquo;Segment Data&rdquo; because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., &ldquo;auto buyers,&rdquo; &ldquo;shoe shoppers,&rdquo; or &ldquo;women 25-35&rdquo;). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of &ldquo;male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion&rdquo;). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the &ldquo;male&rdquo;, &ldquo;shopper&rdquo;, and &ldquo;sports fashion&rdquo; segments). A segment may be identified with a <a href="#_49x2ik5"><u>Label </u></a>(in which case it is referred to as &ldquo;<a href="#_49x2ik5"><u>Label Data</u></a>&rdquo;).</p><h3><a id="_4f1mdlm"></a>Software Development Kit (SDK)</h3><p>See <a href="#_1hmsyys"><u>Pixels, Tags, and SDKs</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_2u6wntf"></a>Tag</h3><p>See <a href="#_1hmsyys"><u>Pixels, Tags, and SDKs</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_19c6y18"></a>TCF</h3><p>See <a href="#_1y810tw"><u>IAB Transparency & Consent Framework</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_3tbugp1"></a>TCF Purpose/Special Purpose/Feature/Special Feature</h3><p>The <a href="#_19c6y18"><u>TCF </u></a>has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes, Features and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry. Through this standardisation, the digital advertising industry can ascribe consistent meanings for the permissions that data subjects give via the <a href="#_19c6y18"><u>TCF</u></a>. This also ensures a consistent experience for users because they then do not have to read and understand an entirely different set of Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features for each website they visit.</p><p>Because of the benefits of standardising the purposes across the industry, we use the <a href="#_19c6y18"><u>TCF </u></a>to establish the legal basis to <a href="#_2grqrue"><u>Process</u></a> <a href="#_32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a> governed by the GDPR, and use the Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features in our Privacy Policy to describe much of our data processing activity.</p><p>For detailed descriptions of TCF Purposes, Special Purposes, Features, and Special Features, see <a href="#_1y810tw"><u>IAB Transparency & Consent Framework</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_28h4qwu"></a>Third Party Cookie/Cookie ID</h3><p>See <a href="#_4d34og8"><u>Cookie</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_nmf14n"></a>Third Party Data</h3><p>Third Party Data is<a href="#_4i7ojhp"><u> Imported Data</u></a> that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via API by third party <a href="#_26in1rg"><u>Data Management Platforms and Data Providers</u></a>. Third Party Data may include <a href="#_1v1yuxt"><u>Segment Data</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_37m2jsg"></a>Training Data</h3><p>Training Data is <a href="#_3fwokq0"><u>Pseudonymous Information</u></a> that we receive from Quantcast Clients and third party data providers, where the actual <a href="#_1fob9te"><u>Attributes</u></a> or <a href="#_3as4poj"><u>Interests</u></a> of the underlying users are known (even though their actual identities are not known to Quantcast). The Training Data is segmented across various <a href="#_3as4poj"><u>Interests </u></a>and <a href="#_1fob9te"><u>Attributes</u></a>, such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make <a href="#_qsh70q"><u>Inferences</u></a>. When our systems subsequently receive <a href="#_1ksv4uv"><u>Event Data</u></a> relating to a user, we can infer whether the <a href="#_1ksv4uv"><u>Event Data</u></a> displays characteristics similar to the Training Data. If the <a href="#_1ksv4uv"><u>Event Data</u></a> displays characteristics that are similar to the Training Data, we can infer from that the likely <a href="#_1fob9te"><u>Attributes</u></a> and <a href="#_3as4poj"><u>Interests</u></a> of the user to whom the <a href="#_1ksv4uv"><u>Event Data</u></a> relates. These <a href="#_qsh70q"><u>Inferences</u></a> are then used to deliver advertising and provide aggregated, analytical reporting to our Quantcast Clients.</p><h3><a id="_1mrcu09"></a>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</h3><p>A URL, also known as a web address, is a reference to a unique web resource that specifies its location on a computer network. Most commonly, a URL points to a web page. URLs can also point to a document, image, video, etc. URLs often use plain text, such as <a href="http://www.quantcast.com"><u>www.quantcast.com</u></a>; in that case, the domain name must be processed by a Domain Name Server in order to convert the domain name into an <a href="#_1pxezwc"><u>IP Address</u></a>. </p>

A characteristic in common may be an <a href="#Attribute"><u>Attribute</u></a>, such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Quantcast Client&rsquo;s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Quantcast Client&rsquo;s advertisement.</p><h3 id="Audience-Insights"><a id="_2et92p0"></a>Audience Insights</h3><p>Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an <a href="#Audience"><u>Audience</u></a>. Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not <a href="#Personal-Information"><u>Personal Information</u></a>. An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.</p><p>Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on <a href="#Event-Data"><u>Event Data</u></a>, <a href="#Bid-Request"><u>Bid Request Data</u></a>, <a href="#Client-Data"><u>Client Data</u></a>, <a href="#Third-Party-Data"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>, and <a href="#Inferred-Data"><u>Inferred Data</u></a> to Quantcast Clients. Audience Insights enable Quantcast Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.</p><h3 id="Bid-Request"><a id="_tyjcwt"></a>Bid Request/Bid Request Data</h3><p>A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher&rsquo;s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and an ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an <a href="#Advertising-Exchange"><u>Advertising Exchange</u></a>. This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the publisher&rsquo;s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard (<a href="https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/"><u>https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/</u></a>), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of one or more <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> (if available), the content that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app, video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (i.e., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as <a href="#TCF"><u>TCF Signals</u></a>. Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast&rsquo;s response to the Bid Request, such as whether a Quantcast Client bid on the ad opportunity.</p><h3 id="Browsing-Data"><a id="_3dy6vkm"></a>Browsing Data</h3><p>Browsing Data is information collected relating to your <a href="#Online-Data"><u>Online</u></a> activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a <a href="#Pixels-Tags-SDK"><u>Pixels, Tags, or SDKs</u></a> installed by a Quantcast Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website <a href="#Uniform-Resource-Locator"><u>URL</u></a> of the page you are visiting, often along with a <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>, as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from <a href="#Request-Header-Information"><u>HTTP Header Information</u></a>, such as referral <a href="#Uniform-Resource-Locator"><u>URLs </u></a>(which is the <a href="#Uniform-Resource-Locator"><u>URL </u></a>that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).</p><p>Browsing Data is included in <a href="#Event-Data"><u>Event Data</u></a>.</p><h3 id="Client-Data"><a id="_1t3h5sf"></a>Client Data</h3><p>Client Data is <a href="#Imported-Data"><u>Imported Data</u></a> that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular Quantcast advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is <a href="#Pseudonymised-Information"><u>Pseudonymised Information,</u></a> which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users&rsquo; <a href="#Online-Data"><u>Online Data</u></a> or <a href="#Offline-Data"><u>Offline Data</u></a>, or other characteristics or aspects of users&rsquo; relationship with the Quantcast Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right <a href="#Audience"><u>Audiences</u></a> and assess their effectiveness, all on behalf of the Quantcast Client.</p><h3 id="Cookie"><a id="_4d34og8"></a>Cookie</h3><p>A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content.

In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If <a href="http://www.example.com"><u>www.example.com</u></a> incorporates Quantcast <a href="#Pixels-Tags-SDK"><u>Pixels, Tags or SDKs</u></a> into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store a <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> in the context of your visits to that site.</p><p>A &ldquo;Third Party Cookie&rdquo; is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting <a href="http://www.example.com"><u>www.example.com</u></a> and a Quantcast <a href="#Pixels-Tags-SDK"><u>Pixel, Tag or SDK </u></a>on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast <a href="#Pixels-Tags-SDK"><u>Pixels, Tags or SDKs</u></a>. Quantcast uses</p><p><a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.</p><p>Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy &ldquo;Information Collection&rdquo; section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy &ldquo;Information Collection&rdquo; section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.</p><h3 id="Cookie-ID"><a id="_2s8eyo1"></a>Cookie ID/Identifier</h3><p>A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a <a href="#Cookie"><u>Cookie</u></a> that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a>. A <a href="#First-Party-Cookie"><u>First Party Cookie</u></a> ID is a unique <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> relating to the <a href="#First-Party-Cookie"><u>First-Party Cookie</u></a> set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A <a href="#Third-Party-Cookie"><u>Third Party Cookie ID</u></a> is a unique<a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u> Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> relating to the <a href="#Third-Party-Cookie"><u>Third-Party Cookie</u></a> set by Quantcast.</p><h3 id="Cookie-Syncing"><a id="_17dp8vu"></a>Cookie Syncing/Matching</h3><p>In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> can determine which of their respective <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as &ldquo;cookie ID 123.&rdquo; Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as &ldquo;cookie ID ABC.&rdquo; Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous identifiers</u></a> may relate to the device that Quantcast records as &ldquo;cookie ID 123&rdquo;.</p><p>Quantcast&rsquo;s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates <a href="#Pixels-Tags-SDK"><u>Pixels, Tags or SDKs</u></a> from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast<a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u> Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> (this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B). Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast&rsquo;s <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>.</p><p>The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing <a href="#Attribute-Information"><u>Attributes</u></a> related to Quantcast <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier.</u></a></p><h3 id="Cross-Media-Matching"><a id="_3rdcrjn"></a>Cross-Media Matching/Linking</h3><p>In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user&rsquo;s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or <a href="#Inferred-Data"><u>Inferred </u></a>to relate to the same user. Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.</p><p>If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is&ldquo;probabilistic&rdquo;&ndash; in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.</p><h3 id="Data-Management-Platforms"><a id="_26in1rg"></a>Data Management Platforms and Data Providers</h3><p>Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide <a href="#Third-Party-Data"><u>Third Party Data</u></a> to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can provide <a href="#Client-Data"><u>Client Data</u></a> to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party <a href="#Audience"><u>Audience</u></a> <a href="#Segment-Data"><u>Segment Data</u></a> from different sources (such as <a href="#Online-Data"><u>Online Data</u></a> and <a href="#Offline-Data"><u>Offline Data</u></a>) to businesses or provide a platform through which Quantcast Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast&rsquo;s use in connection with the Solutions. We share <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> with <a href="#Data-Management-Platforms"><u>Data Management Platforms/Data Providers</u></a> in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see <a href="#Cookie-Syncing"><u>Cookie Syncing/Matching</u></a>).</p><h3 id="Device-ID"><a id="_lnxbz9"></a>Device ID/Identifier</h3><p>A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device&rsquo;s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or &ldquo;Device IDs&rdquo;) serve a similar purpose as <a href="#Cookie"><u>Cookies</u></a> and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>.</p><p>A Mobile Advertising ID (or &ldquo;MAID&rdquo;) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device or connected TV (&ldquo;CTV&rdquo;) device by the device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device&rsquo;s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.</p><h3 id="Device-Configuration"><a id="_35nkun2"></a>Device Configuration/Device Information</h3><p>Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>. The information includes browser, app, or other information about the device (such as device type, screen size and resolution, date and time, and language), which also may include a<a href="#Request-Header-Information"><u> User Agent.</u></a> Some Device Information is derived from <a href="#Request-Header-Information"><u>HTTP Request Header Information</u></a>.</p><h3 id="Email-Address"><a id="_eimewhwtlkbq"></a>Email Address</h3><p>See Hashed Email Address</p><h3 id="Event-Data"><a id="_1ksv4uv"></a>Event Data</h3><p>Information collected relating to your <a href="#Online-Data"><u>Online</u></a> activity/behaviour, which may include<a href="#Personal-Information"><u> Personal Information</u></a> in <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a>, <a href="#Imprecise-Approximate-Location-Information"><u>Imprecise/Approximate Location Information</u></a>, <a href="#Request-Header-Information"><u>HTTP Request Header Information</u></a>, <a href="#Device-ID"><u>Device Information</u></a>, <a href="#Browsing-Data"><u>Browsing Data</u></a> and <a href="#TCF"><u>TCF Signals</u></a>. Event Data is generated when a <a href="#Pixels-Tags-SDK"><u>Pixel, Tag, or SDK</u></a> installed on a Quantcast Client&rsquo;s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a <a href="#Pixels-Tags-SDK"><u>Tag</u></a>.</p><h3 id="Exchange-Advertising-Exchange"><a id="_44sinio"></a>Exchange/Advertising Exchange</h3><p>A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives <a href="#Bid-Request"><u>Bid Requests</u></a> from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to <a href="#Bid-Request"><u>Bid Requests</u></a> with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.</p><h3 id="First-Party-Cookie"><a id="_2jxsxqh"></a>First Party Cookie</h3><p>See <a href="#Cookie"><u>Cookie</u></a>.</p><h3 id="Hashed-Email-Address"><a id="_n4w09y2ozw7i"></a>Hashed Email Address</h3><p>A hashed email address (HEM) is an email address that has been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function. A hashed email is treated as a <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>.</p><h3 id="Request-Header-Information"><a id="_z337ya"></a>HTTP Request Header Information</h3><p>HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a <a href="#Pixels-Tags-SDK"><u>Pixel</u></a> loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a <a href="#Bid-Request"><u>Bid Request</u></a>. We use a subset of the header fields for purposes described in the Privacy Policy, which includes:</p><ul><li><a href="#IP-Address"><u>IP Address</u></a></li><li><a href="#Cookie"><u>Cookie</u></a> (if available)</li><li>User Agent, which is a string (a line of text) identifying the device type, browser type, and version that the user is using to access the web server (&ldquo;User Agent&rdquo;)</li><li>Date, which includes the precise time of access</li><li>Referral <a href="#Uniform-Resource-Locator"><u>URL</u></a>, which is the web page you were on when the request was sent</li><li>TLS Session ID, which identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server</li><li>Content-Language, which is the languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content</li></ul><p>Detailed documentation related to HTTP header information can be found online in a general search for &ldquo;HTTP header information fields&rdquo;.</p><h3 id="IAB-Transparency-Consent-Framework"><a id="_1y810tw"></a>IAB Transparency & Consent Framework (&ldquo;TCF&rdquo;)</h3><p>The IAB Transparency & Consent Framework, or &ldquo;TCF,&rdquo; is a standardised industry program active in countries governed by the GDPR, and designed for notifying users about data <a href="#Process"><u>Processing</u></a> by companies involved in digital advertising on sites and apps that users visit, and for establishing a legal basis for that <a href="#Process"><u>Processing</u></a>.</p><p>The TCF is designed to be used on digital properties, such as websites and apps. The TCF incorporates a consent dialog that displays when users visit a website or app, giving them information about vendors, the data they collect, and the purposes for which they collect it. It also offers an opportunity for users to give or change their permissions for such data collection and use.</p><p>The TCF allows Quantcast to work with publishers of websites and other digital properties in a consistent manner using standardised technical specifications to:</p><p>(a) provide a link to Quantcast's Privacy Policy, as well as transparency about Quantcast's <a href="#Process"><u>Processing</u></a> of <a href="#Personal-Information"><u>Personal Information</u></a>, the specific purposes for which Quantcast <a href="#Process"><u>Processes </u></a><a href="#Personal-Information"><u>Personal Information</u></a>, and Quantcast's legal basis for such <a href="#Process"><u>Processing</u></a>, directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user;</p><p>(b) allow the user, in a granular manner, to express their consent or refusal to consent, to Quantcast's (i) use of <a href="#Cookie"><u>Cookies</u></a>, and (ii) the purposes of Quantcast's <a href="#Process"><u>Processing</u></a>, which are the reasons why Quantcast <a href="#Process"><u>Processes </u></a>the personal data of users (&ldquo;<a href="#TCF"><u>TCF Purposes&rdquo;</u></a>), including where Quantcast relies on the user&rsquo;s consent for such <a href="#Process"><u>Processing </u></a>directly on the website or other digital property that the user is accessing;</p><p>(c) allow the user to object to Quantcast's <a href="#Process"><u>Processing </u></a>of <a href="#Personal-Information"><u>Personal Information</u></a> (for purposes where Quantcast relies on legitimate interests) directly on the website or other digital property accessed by the user.</p><p>Using the <a href="#TCF"><u>TCF </u></a>allows publishers of websites or other digital properties to provide information about Quantcast&rsquo;s <a href="#Process"><u>Processing </u></a>to users in a consistent manner. The user-facing disclosures presented by these digital properties are sourced from information that Quantcast has registered with the <a href="#TCF"><u>TCF's </u></a>&ldquo;<a href="https://iabeurope.eu/vendor-list-tcf-v2-0/"><u>Global Vendor List</u></a>&rdquo;, a publicly accessible, machine-readable repository of information about TCF-compliant vendors, like Quantcast. This information includes Quantcast&rsquo;s Privacy Policy <a href="#Uniform-Resource-Locator"><u>URL</u></a>, the purposes for which it <a href="#Process"><u>Processes</u></a> <a href="#Personal-Information"><u>Personal Information</u></a>, and its legal basis for each of these purposes. As the description of these purposes and minimum standards for disclosures are standardised across all TCF participants, Quantcast knows how operators of websites or other digital properties using the TCF are making disclosures about Quantcast and can have confidence in such disclosures.</p><p>In addition, the TCF enables publishers of websites or other digital properties to create and send to Quantcast a standardised technical signal that indicates (A) whether Quantcast&rsquo;s transparency disclosures were provided to a user; (B) whether or not the user has consented to Quantcast&rsquo;s <a href="#Process"><u>Processing </u></a>and/or each purpose for which Quantcast sought the user's consent; and (c) whether the user objected to Quantcast&rsquo;s <a href="#Process"><u>Processing </u></a>and/or any purposes for which Quantcast <a href="#Process"><u>Processes </u></a><a href="#Personal-Information"><u>Personal Information </u></a>on the basis of its legitimate interests (the &ldquo;TCF Signal&rdquo;).</p><p>TCF Signal is collected via Quantcast <a href="#Pixels-Tags-SDK"><u>Tags</u></a> if the digital property on which the <a href="#Pixels-Tags-SDK"><u>Tag </u></a>is implemented has also implemented a TCF-compatible Consent Management Platform, which is a company or organisation that centralises and manages transparency for, and consent and objections of, the user (&ldquo;CMP&rdquo;) . In addition, TCF Signal is received by Quantcast as part of the <a href="#Bid-Request"><u>Bid Requests</u></a> it receives from <a href="#Advertising-Exchange"><u>Advertising Exchanges</u></a>. Quantcast is able to read the standardised TCF Signal and will only <a href="#Process"><u>Process </u></a><a href="#Personal-Information"><u>Personal Information</u></a> for purposes to which the user has consented (where consent is the legal basis) or not objected (where legitimate interests is the legal basis) in order to provide the Solutions.</p><p>Read more about the TCF here <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/"><u>https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/</u></a></p><h3 id="Imported-Data"><a id="_4i7ojhp"></a>Imported Data</h3><p>Imported Data is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an Application Programming Interface (&ldquo;API&rdquo;). Imported Data is <a href="#Pseudonymised-Information"><u>Pseudonymised Information</u></a>, which may include information relating to your <a href="#Online-Data"><u>Online data</u></a> or <a href="#Offline-Data"><u>Offline data</u></a> or other information that Quantcast Clients or partners have about you. For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see <a href="#Client-Data"><u>Client Data</u></a> or <a href="#Third-Party-Data"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_2xcytpi"></a>Imported Data (Client)</h3><p>See <a href="#Client-Data"><u>Client Data</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_1ci93xb"></a>Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)</h3><p>See <a href="#Third-Party-Data"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>.</p><h3 id="Imprecise-Approximate-Location-Information"><a id="_3whwml4"></a>Imprecise/Approximate Location Information</h3><p>Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.</p><p>Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one meter. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Quantcast Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.</p><p>Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from <a href="#IP-Address"><u>IP Addresses</u></a>.</p><h3 id="Inferred-Data"><a id="_qsh70q"></a>Inferences/Inferred Data</h3><p>Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as <a href="#Event-Data"><u>Event Data</u></a>, <a href="#Bid-Request"><u>Bid Request Data</u></a>,<a href="#Client-Data"><u> Client Data</u></a>, or <a href="#Third-Party-Data"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>. Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> as part of a set of device <a href="#Attribute-Information"><u>Attributes</u></a>.</p><p>For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider&rsquo;s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel. Other Inferences include things such as <a href="#Interests"><u>Interests</u></a>, income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.</p><p>Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an <a href="#Audience"><u>Audience</u></a>.</p><h3 id="Interests"><a id="_3as4poj"></a>Interests</h3><p>Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include &ldquo;cooking&rdquo; and &ldquo;outdoor activities&rdquo;. Interests may be derived from <a href="#Event-Data"><u>Event Data</u></a>, <a href="#Bid-Request"><u>Bid Request Data</u></a>, <a href="#Client-Data"><u>Client Data</u></a>, <a href="#Third-Party-Data"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>, and <a href="#Inferred-Data"><u>Inferences/Inferred Data</u></a>.</p><h3 id="IP-Address"><a id="_1pxezwc"></a>IP Address</h3><p>An IP (&ldquo;Internet Protocol&rdquo;) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device&rsquo;s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.</p><h3 id="Label-Data"><a id="_49x2ik5"></a>Labels/Label Data</h3><p>Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a &ldquo;label&rdquo; to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as &ldquo;Work,&rdquo; family members as &ldquo;Family,&rdquo; and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.</p><p>Labels processed by Quantcast are:</p><ul><li>Labels from <a href="#Data-Management-Platforms"><u>Data Management Platforms and Data Providers</u></a> : these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>;</li><li>Custom-<a href="#Client-Data"><u>Client Data</u></a> Labels: these are custom category labels set by Quantcast Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).</li><li><a href="#Inferred-Data"><u>Inferred Data</u></a> Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>, e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.</li></ul><p>Example Labels are &ldquo;male&rdquo; and &ldquo;visited XYZ website&rdquo;. Labels may be inferred information (see <a href="#Inferred-Data"><u>Inferences/Inferred Data</u></a>) or may be<a href="#Imported-Data"><u> Imported Data</u></a> (see <a href="#Client-Data"><u>Client Data</u></a> and <a href="#Third-Party-Data"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>).</p><h3 id="Log-Data"><a id="_2p2csry"></a>Log Data</h3><p>Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our <a href="#Process"><u>Processing</u></a>, we use more precise terms, such as <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a>, <a href="#Event-Data"><u>Event Data</u></a>, <a href="#Bid-Request"><u>Bid Request Data</u></a>, <a href="#Client-Data"><u>Client Data</u></a>, <a href="#Third-Party-Data"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>, and/or <a href="#Inferred-Data"><u>Inferences/Inferred Data</u></a>, which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term &ldquo;Log Data.&rdquo; Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a>, will not qualify as <a href="#Personal-Information"><u>Personal Information</u></a>. For example, a single time zone and publisher <a href="#Uniform-Resource-Locator"><u>URL</u></a> without an associated <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier </u></a>would not qualify as <a href="#Personal-Information"><u>Personal Information</u></a>.</p><h3 id="Online-Data"><a id="_147n2zr"></a>Online Data</h3><p>Data relating to a user&rsquo;s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.</p><h3 id="Offline-Data"><a id="_23ckvvd"></a>Offline Data</h3><p>Data relating to a user&rsquo;s real-world purchases and/or activity.</p><h3 id="Panel"><a id="_ihv636"></a>Panel</h3><p>A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.</p><p>This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.</p><p>Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.</p><h3 id="Personal-Information"><a id="_32hioqz"></a>Personal Information</h3><p>Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as &ldquo;personal data.&rdquo;</p><p>The Personal Information <a href="#Process"><u>Processed</u></a> by Quantcast is limited to <a href="#Probabilistic-Identifier"><u>Pseudonymised Identifiers</u></a> Quantcast does not <a href="#Process"><u>Process</u></a> <a href="#Personal-Information"><u>Personal Information</u></a> that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.</p><h3 id="Pixels-Tags-SDK"><a id="_1hmsyys"></a>Pixels, Tags, and SDKs</h3><p>Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website, mobile applications, and advertisements that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Quantcast Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive <a href="#Request-Header-Information"><u>HTTP Header Information</u></a>, along with other information that is configured by the Quantcast Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.</p><p>Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:</p><ul><li>Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.</li><li>Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Quantcast Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.</li><li>Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients&rsquo; web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.</li><li>Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.</li><li>SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.</li></ul><h3 id="Probabilistic-Identifier"><a id="_41mghml"></a>Probabilistic Identifier</h3><p>A Probabilistic Identifier is a <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> which we create by combining <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> (such as <a href="#IP-Address"><u>IP Addresses</u></a>) with <a href="#Bid-Request"><u>Bid Request Data</u></a> and/or <a href="#Event-Data"><u>Event Data</u></a> using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using <a href="#Cookie-ID"><u>Cookie IDs</u></a>, this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.</p><h3 id="Process"><a id="_2grqrue"></a>Process</h3><p>Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon <a href="#Personal-Information"><u>Personal Information</u></a> or sets of <a href="#Personal-Information"><u>Personal Information</u></a>, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.</p><h3 id="Pseudonymous-Identifiers"><a id="_n270so602c2d"></a>Pseudonymous Identifiers</h3><p>Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.</p><p>Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.</p><p>We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:</p><ul><li>Third Party Cookie ID: see <a href="#Cookie-ID"><u>Cookie ID</u></a>.</li><li>First Party Cookie ID: see <a href="#Cookie-ID"><u>Cookie ID</u></a>.</li><li><a href="#IP-Address"><u>IP Addresses</u></a>.</li><li><a href="#Email-Address"><u>Hashed email addresses</u></a></li><li>Third party identifiers</li><li><a href="#Device-ID"><u>Device ID</u></a>.</li><li>Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.</li><li>Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).</li><li>Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a <a href="#Bid-Request"><u>Bid Request</u></a> that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.</li><li><a href="#Probabilistic-Identifier"><u>Probabilistic Identifier</u></a>.</li><li>Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.</li><li>TLS Session ID: when you visit a website <a href="#Uniform-Resource-Locator"><u>URL</u></a> that starts with &ldquo;https&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;http&rdquo;, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our <a href="#Pixels-Tags-SDK"><u>Pixels, Tags or SDKs</u></a> loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted.

This category of information is typically called &ldquo;Segment Data&rdquo; because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., &ldquo;auto buyers,&rdquo; &ldquo;shoe shoppers,&rdquo; or &ldquo;women 25-35&rdquo;). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of &ldquo;male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion&rdquo;). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the &ldquo;male&rdquo;, &ldquo;shopper&rdquo;, and &ldquo;sports fashion&rdquo; segments). A segment may be identified with a <a href="#Label-Data"><u>Label </u></a>(in which case it is referred to as &ldquo;<a href="#Label-Data"><u>Label Data</u></a>&rdquo;).</p><h3 id="Software-Development-Kit"><a id="_4f1mdlm"></a>Software Development Kit (SDK)</h3><p>See <a href="#Pixels-Tags-SDK"><u>Pixels, Tags, and SDKs</u></a>.</p><h3 id="Tag"><a id="_2u6wntf"></a>Tag</h3><p>See <a href="#Pixels-Tags-SDK"><u>Pixels, Tags, and SDKs</u></a>.</p><h3 id="TCF"><a id="_19c6y18"></a>TCF</h3><p>See <a href="#IAB-Transparency-Consent-Framework"><u>IAB Transparency & Consent Framework</u></a>.</p><h3 id="Special-Purpose"><a id="_3tbugp1"></a>TCF Purpose/Special Purpose/Feature/Special Feature</h3><p>The <a href="#TCF"><u>TCF </u></a>has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes, Features and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry.

The Training Data is segmented across various <a href="#Interests"><u>Interests </u></a>and <a href="#Attribute-Information"><u>Attributes</u></a>, such as shopping interests (e.g., automotive, technology, or restaurants), business and occupation (e.g., management, IT professional or retail), media interests (e.g., cinema, video games, TV), income range, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information and used for data modeling purposes. We use the Training Data to train statistical models to make <a href="#Inferred-Data"><u>Inferences</u></a>.

A characteristic in common may be an <a href="#Interest">Interest</a>, such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an <a href="#Attribute">Attribute</a>, such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement.

Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not <a href="#Personal-Information">Personal Information</a>.  An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.</p><p dir="ltr">Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on <a href="#Event-data">Event Data</a>, <a href="#Bid-Request">Bid Request Data</a>, <a href="#Client-data">Client Data</a>, <a href="#Third-party-data">Third Party Data</a>, and Inferred Data to Clients. Audience Insights enable Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Bid-Request">Bid Request/Bid Request Data</h3><p dir="ltr">A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher&rsquo;s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and one ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an <a href="#Advertising-Exchange">Advertising Exchange</a>. This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the  publisher&rsquo;s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard (<a href="https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/">https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/</a>), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of a <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifier">Pseudonymous Identifier</a> (if available), the content  that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app,  video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (i.e., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1y810tw">TCF Signals</a>. Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast&rsquo;s response to the Bid Request, such as whether Quantcast bid on the ad opportunity.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Browsing-Data">Browsing Data</h3><p dir="ltr">Browsing Data is information collected relating to your <a href="#Online">Online</a> activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a <a href="#Pixels-Tags">Pixels, Tags, or SDKs</a> installed by a Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website <a href="#URL">URL</a> of the page you are visiting, often along with a <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifier">Pseudonymous Identifier</a>, as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from <a href="#HTTP-Header-Information">HTTP Header Information</a>, such as referral <a href="#URLs">URLs </a>(which is the <a href="#URL">URL </a>that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you). </p><p dir="ltr">Browsing Data is included in <a href="#Event-Data">Event Data</a>. </p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Client-Data">Client Data</h3><p dir="ltr">Client Data is <a href="#Imported-Data">Imported Data</a> that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is <a href="#Pseudonymised-Information">Pseudonymised Information,</a> which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users&rsquo; <a href="#Online-Data">Online Data</a> or <a href="#Offline-Data">Offline Data</a>, or other characteristics or aspects of users&rsquo; relationship with the Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right <a href="#Audiences">Audiences</a> on behalf of the Client. </p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Cookie">Cookie</h3><p dir="ltr">A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Clients&rsquo; advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are <a href="#Pseudonymous-Information">Pseudonymous Information</a>; in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a<a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifier"> Pseudonymous Identifier</a> to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers">Pseudonymous Identifiers</a> or <a href="#Pseudonymous-Information">Pseudonymous Information</a> from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details. </p><p dir="ltr">There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies. </p><p dir="ltr">A &ldquo;First Party Cookie&rdquo; is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (&ldquo;First Party Cookie&rdquo;). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If <a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a> incorporates Quantcast <a href="#Pixels-tags">Pixels, Tags or SDKs</a> into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store  a <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifier">Pseudonymous Identifier</a> in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifier">Pseudonymous Identifier</a> in the context of your visits to that site.  </p><p dir="ltr">A &ldquo;Third Party Cookie&rdquo; is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting <a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a> and a Quantcast <a href="#Pixels-tags">Pixel, Tag or SDK </a>on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast <a href="#Pixels-tags">Pixels, Tags or SDKs</a>. Quantcast uses</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers">Pseudonymous Identifiers</a> stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.</p><p dir="ltr">Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy &ldquo;Information Collection&rdquo; section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy &ldquo;Information Collection&rdquo; section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Cookie-ID">Cookie ID/Identifier</h3><p dir="ltr">A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a <a href="#Cookie">Cookie</a> that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are  <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers">Pseudonymous Identifiers</a>. A <a href="#First-Party">First Party Cookie</a> ID is a unique <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifier">Pseudonymous Identifier</a> relating to the <a href="#First-Party">First-Party Cookie</a> set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A <a href="#Third-Party-Cookie-ID">Third Party Cookie ID</a> is a unique<a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifier"> Pseudonymous Identifier</a> relating to the <a href="#Third-Party-Cookie">Third-Party Cookie</a> set by Quantcast. </p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Cookie-Syncing">Cookie Syncing/Matching</h3><p dir="ltr">In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifier">Pseudonymous Identifier </a>can determine which of their respective <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers">Pseudonymous Identifiers</a> may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as &ldquo;cookie ID 123.&rdquo; Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as &ldquo;cookie ID ABC.&rdquo; Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers">Pseudonymous identifiers </a>may relate to the device that Quantcast records as &ldquo;cookie ID 123&rdquo;. </p><p dir="ltr">Quantcast&rsquo;s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates <a href="#Pixels-Tags">Pixels, Tags or SDKs</a> from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast<a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers"> Pseudonymous Identifiers </a>(this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B).  Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast&rsquo;s <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifier">Pseudonymous Identifier</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing <a href="#Attributes">Attributes</a> related to Quantcast <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers">Pseudonymous Identifiers </a>with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifier">Pseudonymous Identifier.</a></p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Cross-Media-Matching">Cross-Media Matching/Linking</h3><p dir="ltr">In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user&rsquo;s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or <a href="#Inferred">Inferred </a>to relate to the same user.  Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile. </p><p dir="ltr">If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers">Pseudonymous Identifiers</a> associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is&ldquo;probabilistic&rdquo;&ndash; in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user. </p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Data-Management-Platforms">Data Management Platforms and Data Providers</h3><p dir="ltr">Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide <a href="#Third-Party-Data">Third Party Data</a> to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Clients can provide <a href="#Client-data">Client Data</a> to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party <a href="#Audience-Segment-Data">Audience Segment Data</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1v1yuxt"></a>from different sources (such as <a href="#Online-Data">Online Data</a> and <a href="#Offline-Data">Offline Data</a>) to businesses or provide a platform through which Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast&rsquo;s use in connection with the Solutions. We share <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers">Pseudonymous Identifiers</a> with <a href="#Data-Management-Platforms">Data Management Platforms/Data Providers</a> in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see <a href="#Cookie-Syncing">Cookie Syncing/Matching</a>). </p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Device-ID">Device ID/Identifier</h3><p dir="ltr">A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device&rsquo;s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or &ldquo;Device IDs&rdquo;) serve a similar purpose as <a href="#Cookies">Cookies</a> and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifier">Pseudonymous Identifier</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">A Mobile Advertising ID (or &ldquo;MAID&rdquo;) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device  or connected TV (&ldquo;CTV&rdquo;) device by the device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device&rsquo;s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices. </p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Device-Configuration">Device Configuration/Device Information</h3><p dir="ltr">Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifier">Pseudonymous Identifier</a>. The information includes browser, app, or other information about the device (such as device type, screen size and resolution, date and time, and language), which also may include a<a href="#User-Agent"> User Agent.</a> Some Device Information is derived from <a href="#HTTP-Request-Header-Information">HTTP Request Header Information</a>. </p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Event-Data">Event Data</h3><p dir="ltr">Information collected relating to your <a href="#Online">Online</a> activity/behaviour, which may include<a href="#Personal-information"> Personal Information</a> in <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers">Pseudonymous Identifiers</a>, <a href="#Imprecise-Approximate-Location">Imprecise/Approximate Location Information</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.z337ya">HTTP Request Header Information</a>, <a href="#Device-Information">Device Information</a>, <a href="#Browsing-Data">Browsing Data</a> and <a href="#TCF-Signals">TCF Signals</a>.

An Advertising Exchange receives Bid Requests from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to <a href="#Bid-Requests">Bid Requests</a> with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="First-Party-Cookie">First Party Cookie</h3><p dir="ltr">See <a href="#Cookie">Cookie</a>.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="HTTP-Request-Header-Information">HTTP Request Header Information</h3><p dir="ltr">HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are.

Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.  </p><p dir="ltr">Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from GPS coordinates or from <a href="#IP-address">IP Addresses</a>.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Inferences-inferred-data">Inferences/Inferred Data</h3><p dir="ltr">Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as <a href="#Event-data">Event Data</a>, <a href="#Bid-request-data">Bid Request Data</a>,<a href="#Client-data"> Client Data</a>, or <a href="#Third-party-data">Third Party Data</a>. Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifier">Pseudonymous Identifier</a> as part of a set of device <a href="#Attributes">Attributes</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider&rsquo;s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel.  Other Inferences  include things such as <a href="#Interests">Interests</a>, income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information. </p><p dir="ltr">Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an <a href="#Audience">Audience</a>.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Interests">Interests</h3><p dir="ltr">Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with Pseudonymous Identifiers to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include &ldquo;cooking&rdquo; and &ldquo;outdoor activities&rdquo;. Interests may be derived from <a href="#Event-data">Event Data</a>, <a href="#Bid-request">Bid Request Data</a>, <a href="#Client-data">Client Data</a>, <a href="#Third-party-data">Third Party Data</a>, and Inferences/Inferred Data.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="IP-address">IP Address</h3><p dir="ltr">An IP (&ldquo;Internet Protocol&rdquo;) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device&rsquo;s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router. </p><p dir="ltr">An IP Address that has been hashed, or encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email, is treated as a <a href="https://Pseudonymous-Identifier">Pseudonymous Identifier</a>.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Labels-label-data">Labels/Label Data</h3><p dir="ltr">Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227">Pseudonymous Identifiers</a> to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers">Pseudonymous Identifiers</a> associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a &ldquo;label&rdquo; to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as &ldquo;Work&rdquo;, family members as &ldquo;Family,&rdquo; and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.</p><p dir="ltr">Labels processed by Quantcast are:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Labels from <a href="https://Data-management-platforms">Data Management Platforms and Data Providers</a> : these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifier">Pseudonymous Identifier</a>;</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Custom-<a href="#Client-data">Client Data</a> Labels: these are custom category labels set by Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><a href="#Inferred-Data">Inferred Data</a> Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227">Pseudonymous Identifier</a>, e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.</p></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Example Labels are &ldquo;male&rdquo; and &ldquo;visited XYZ website&rdquo;.

For purposes of describing our <a href="#Process">Processing</a>, we use more precise terms, such as Pseudonymous Identifiers, <a href="#Event-data">Event Data</a>, <a href="#Bid-request-data">Bid Request Data</a>, <a href="#Client-data">Client Data</a>, <a href="#Third-party-data">Third Party Data</a>, and/or Inferences/Inferred Data, which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term &ldquo;Log Data&rdquo;. Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers">Pseudonymous Identifiers</a>, will not qualify as Personal Information. For example, a single time zone and publisher <a href="#URL">URL</a> without an associated <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifier">Pseudonymous Identifier </a>would not qualify as <a href="#Personal-information">Personal Information</a>.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Online-data">Online Data </h3><p dir="ltr">Data relating to a user&rsquo;s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services. </p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Offline-data">Offline Data</h3><p dir="ltr">Data relating to a user&rsquo;s real-world purchases and/or activity.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Panel">Panel</h3><p dir="ltr">A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.</p><p dir="ltr">This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50. </p><p dir="ltr">Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong. </p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Personal-information">Personal Information</h3><p dir="ltr">Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as &ldquo;personal data.&rdquo; </p><p dir="ltr">The Personal Information <a href="#Process">Processed </a>by Quantcast is limited to Pseudonymised Identifiers. Quantcast does not <a href="#Process">Process</a> <a href="#Personal-information">Personal Information</a> that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Pixels-tags">Pixels, Tags, and SDKs</h3><p dir="ltr">Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive <a href="#HTTP-header-information">HTTP Header Information</a>, along with other information that is configured by the Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.</p><p dir="ltr">Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:</p><p dir="ltr">Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers">Pseudonymous Identifiers</a> between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients&rsquo; web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads. </p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads. </p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy. </p></li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Probabilistic-Identifier">Probabilistic Identifier</h3><p dir="ltr">A Probabilistic Identifier is a Pseudonymous Identifier which we create by combining <a href="#Pseudonymous-Identifiers">Pseudonymous Identifiers</a> (such as IP Addresses) with Bid Request Data and/or Event Data using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using Cookie IDs, this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Process">Process</h3><p dir="ltr">Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon Personal Information or sets of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.32hioqz">Personal Information</a>, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Pseudonymous-identifiers">Pseudonymous Identifiers</h3><p dir="ltr">Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same. </p><p dir="ltr">Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.</p><p dir="ltr">We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:</p><div><br /></div><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Third Party Cookie ID: see <a href="#Cookie-ID">Cookie ID</a>.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">First Party Cookie ID: see <a href="#Cookie-ID">Cookie ID</a>.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><a href="#IP-Address">IP Addresses</a>.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Hashed email addresses, which are email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Third party identifiers</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><a href="#Device-ID">Device ID</a>.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity). </p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a <a href="#Bid-request">Bid Request</a> that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><a href="#Probabilistic-Identifier">Probabilistic Identifier</a>.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.</p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">TLS Session ID: when you visit a website <a href="#URL">URL</a> that starts with &ldquo;https&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;http&rdquo;, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our <a href="#Pixels-tags">Pixels, Tags or SDKs</a> loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server. </p></li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information</h3><p dir="ltr">Pseudonymised Information is <a href="#Personal-information">Personal Information</a> that has been <a href="#Processed">Processed</a> in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user. </p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Segment-data">Segment Data</h3><p dir="ltr">Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by Clients or Third Party Data Partners.

This category of information is typically called &ldquo;Segment Data&rdquo; because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., &ldquo;auto buyers,&rdquo; &ldquo;shoe shoppers,&rdquo; or &ldquo;women 25-35&rdquo;). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of &ldquo;male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion&rdquo;). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the &ldquo;male&rdquo;, &ldquo;shopper&rdquo;, and &ldquo;sports fashion&rdquo; segments).

Audience Insights enable Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Bid Request/Bid Request Data</h3><p dir="ltr">A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher&rsquo;s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and one ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.30j0zll">Advertising Exchange</a>. This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the  publisher&rsquo;s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard (<a href="https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/">https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/</a>), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227">Pseudonymous Identifier</a> (if available), the content  that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app,  video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (i.e., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1y810tw">TCF Signals</a>. Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast&rsquo;s response to the Bid Request, such as whether Quantcast bid on the ad opportunity.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Browsing Data</h3><p dir="ltr">Browsing Data is information collected relating to your <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.147n2zr">Online</a> activity or behaviour.

For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as &ldquo;cookie ID 123.&rdquo; Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as &ldquo;cookie ID ABC.&rdquo; Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227">Pseudonymous identifiers </a>may relate to the device that Quantcast records as &ldquo;cookie ID 123&rdquo;. </p><p dir="ltr">Quantcast&rsquo;s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1hmsyys">Pixels, Tags or SDKs</a> from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227"> Pseudonymous Identifiers </a>(this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B).  Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227">Pseudonymous Identifier</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1fob9te">Attributes</a> related to Quantcast <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227">Pseudonymous Identifiers </a>with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227">Pseudonymous Identifier.</a></p><h3 dir="ltr">Cross-Media Matching/Linking</h3><p dir="ltr">In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user&rsquo;s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.qsh70q">Inferred </a>to relate to the same user.  Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile. </p><p dir="ltr">If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.vx1227">Pseudonymous Identifiers</a> associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is&ldquo;probabilistic&rdquo;&ndash; in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user. </p><h3 dir="ltr">Data Management Platforms and Data Providers</h3><p dir="ltr">Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.nmf14n">Third Party Data</a> to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Clients can provide <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10BUoD6PFOZdePgxuUXdzul3mGkpauFYY0Tu4OAjDXtk/edit#heading=h.1t3h5sf">Client Data</a> to Quantcast.

Examples of attributes are &ldquo;male&rdquo; and &ldquo;visited XYZ website&rdquo;. Attributes may be derived from <a href="#_heading=h.1ksv4uv"><u>Event Data</u></a>, Bid Request Data, <a href="#_heading=h.1t3h5sf"><u>Client Data</u></a>,<a href="#_heading=h.nmf14n"><u> Third Party Data</u></a>, and <a href="#_heading=h.qsh70q"><u>Inferences/Inferred Data</u></a>. Quantcast associates attributes with <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.3znysh7"></a>Audience</h3><p>An Audience is a group of devices and/or users who are known to or are estimated to have certain common characteristics. A characteristic in common may be an <a href="#_heading=h.3as4poj"><u>Interest</u></a>, such as an interest in cooking. A characteristic in common may be an <a href="#_heading=h.1fob9te"><u>Attribute</u></a>, such as being male, visited a particular digital property, or viewed or interacted with a particular advertisement. One type of Audience is a group who have visited a Client&rsquo;s digital property. Another type of Audience is a group who have been shown, or may potentially be shown, a Client&rsquo;s advertisement.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.2et92p0"></a>Audience Insights</h3><p>Audience Insights are data collected, or data that is inferred from data collected, about an <a href="#_heading=h.3znysh7"><u>Audience</u></a>. Audience Insights are aggregated, anonymised data and are not <a href="#_heading=h.32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a>. An example of an Audience Insight is a report that a given audience is estimated to be 70% male and 3 times as likely to be interested in cooking compared to the general population.</p><p>Quantcast provides Audience Insights based on <a href="#_heading=h.1ksv4uv"><u>Event Data</u></a>, <a href="#_heading=h.tyjcwt"><u>Bid Request Data</u></a>, <a href="#_heading=h.1t3h5sf"><u>Client Data</u></a>, <a href="#_heading=h.nmf14n"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>, and <a href="#_heading=h.qsh70q"><u>Inferred Data</u></a> to Clients. Audience Insights enable Clients to better understand the audiences who engage with their content and ads.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.tyjcwt"></a>Bid Request/Bid Request Data</h3><p>A Bid Request is a request by a digital content publisher (e.g., website owner, app developer, streaming content provider, etc.) for an offer to place an ad in the publisher&rsquo;s digital content. For example, when you visit an ad-supported web page, Bid Requests are sent by, or on behalf of, the publisher of the web page to multiple parties that may want to show an ad to you. Those parties can bid for the opportunity to show an ad in an auction, and one ad is selected to show on the page. Bid Requests typically go through an <a href="#_heading=h.30j0zll"><u>Advertising Exchange</u></a>. This all happens via digital communication between computer servers in less than a second. The contents of the Bid Request may include information about the ad unit (the container in the digital content that will display the ad), the digital content, the device it will be seen on, and your engagement with the publisher&rsquo;s digital content, so that prospective buyers can choose whether to bid and how much. For most cases, the contents of the Bid Request are defined by the OpenRTB industry standard (<a href="https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/"><u>https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb/</u></a>), though not all fields are necessarily included in every Bid Request. Bid Request Data consists of data provided in the Bid Request and will commonly consist of a <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> (if available), the content that the ad would serve in (such as the web page, app, video, etc.), the type of device the ad would be served on (i.e., your device type), the approximate geographic location of your device, the size of the ad, the auction ID, and consent information, such as <a href="#_heading=h.1y810tw"><u>TCF Signals</u></a>. Bid Request Data also includes Quantcast&rsquo;s response to the Bid Request, such as whether Quantcast bid on the ad opportunity.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.3dy6vkm"></a>Browsing Data</h3><p>Browsing Data is information collected relating to your <a href="#_heading=h.147n2zr"><u>Online</u></a> activity or behaviour. Browsing Data is generated when a <a href="#_heading=h.1hmsyys"><u>Pixels, Tags, or SDKs</u></a> installed by a Client on its digital property loads and sends information to us. This includes the website <a href="#_heading=h.1mrcu09"><u>URL</u></a> of the page you are visiting, often along with a <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>, as well as fields of information that may be automatically included from <a href="#_heading=h.z337ya"><u>HTTP Header Information</u></a>, such as referral <a href="#_heading=h.1mrcu09"><u>URLs </u></a>(which is the <a href="#_heading=h.1mrcu09"><u>URL </u></a>that directed your browser to the website where an advertisement was served to you).</p><p>Browsing Data is included in <a href="#_heading=h.1ksv4uv"><u>Event Data</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.1t3h5sf"></a>Client Data</h3><p>Client Data is <a href="#_heading=h.4i7ojhp"><u>Imported Data</u></a> that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform by a particular advertiser Client for use on its behalf. Client Data is <a href="#_heading=h.3fwokq0"><u>Pseudonymised Information,</u></a> which defines groups of users. These groups might typically be based on users&rsquo; <a href="#_heading=h.147n2zr"><u>Online Data</u></a> or <a href="#_heading=h.23ckvvd"><u>Offline Data</u></a>, or other characteristics or aspects of users&rsquo; relationship with the Client. The groups are then used by Quantcast to help deliver advertising campaigns to the right <a href="#_heading=h.3znysh7"><u>Audiences</u></a> on behalf of the Client.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.4d34og8"></a>Cookie</h3><p>A Cookie is a small bit of text that is sent to and saved on your computer or device when you visit a website. A Cookie is associated with a single web browser profile; each web browser and browser profile that you use on your device will have separate Cookies. Cookies allow a website to recognise a browser and are commonly used to store user preferences or identifiers, which enables us to collect and use information about browsers over time and across different internet content. Cookies enable us to understand more about users and the content they are visiting over time, which in turn can be used to improve our Clients&rsquo; advertising activities and the quality of advertising you experience. The identifiers we store in Cookies are <a href="#_heading=h.3fwokq0"><u>Pseudonymous Information</u></a>; in other words, they cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link a<a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u> Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> or <a href="#_heading=h.3fwokq0"><u>Pseudonymous Information</u></a> from doing the same. Browsers have controls that enable users to clear or block Cookies. See your browser help for details.</p><p>There are two forms of cookies: First Party Cookies and Third Party Cookies.</p><p>A &ldquo;First Party Cookie&rdquo; is limited in scope to a particular website you visit (&ldquo;<strong>First Party Cookie</strong>&rdquo;). In some instances, Quantcast is able to store or access information in a First Party Cookie. If <a href="http://www.example.com"><u>www.example.com</u></a> incorporates Quantcast <a href="#_heading=h.1hmsyys"><u>Pixels, Tags or SDKs</u></a> into their website, and if you visit www.example.com, Quantcast may set a First-Party Cookie associated with www.example.com. In these instances, Quantcast can store a <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> in the First-Party Cookie, but because it is a First Party Cookie, Quantcast can only access that <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> in the context of your visits to that site.</p><p>A &ldquo;Third Party Cookie&rdquo; is a cookie associated with an internet domain that is different from the one you are visiting. For example, if you are visiting <a href="http://www.example.com"><u>www.example.com</u></a> and a Quantcast <a href="#_heading=h.1hmsyys"><u>Pixel, Tag or SDK </u></a>on that website is able to set a cookie associated with quantcast.com, that is a Third Party Cookie. That same cookie will be accessible to Quantcast on other sites that also incorporate Quantcast <a href="#_heading=h.1hmsyys"><u>Pixels, Tags or SDKs</u></a>. Quantcast uses</p><p><a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> stored in Third Party Cookies in order to collect information across multiple websites.</p><p>Quantcast Cookies placed on your device have a maximum expiry period of 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy &ldquo;Information Collection&rdquo; section). Each time you visit a website and a First or Third Party Cookie is placed on your device, the placement of a Cookie begins a new expiry period of up to 13 months (or such shorter period as described in the Privacy Policy &ldquo;Information Collection&rdquo; section). All Quantcast Cookies automatically cease providing any data to Quantcast from your browser upon expiration.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.2s8eyo1"></a>Cookie ID/Identifier</h3><p>A Cookie ID is a unique string of characters that we store in a <a href="#_heading=h.4d34og8"><u>Cookie</u></a> that allows us to identify a single web browser instance over time and across different web sites. Our Cookie IDs are <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a>. A <a href="#_heading=h.2jxsxqh"><u>First Party Cookie</u></a> ID is a unique <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> relating to the <a href="#_heading=h.2jxsxqh"><u>First-Party Cookie</u></a> set by the owner of the website you are visiting. A <a href="#_heading=h.28h4qwu"><u>Third Party Cookie ID</u></a> is a unique<a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u> Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> relating to the <a href="#_heading=h.28h4qwu"><u>Third-Party Cookie</u></a> set by Quantcast.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.17dp8vu"></a>Cookie Syncing/Matching</h3><p>In the online advertising industry, Cookie Syncing/Matching generally refers to a process through which two entities who each, and separately, identify a device using their own <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier </u></a>can determine which of their respective <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> may relate to the same device. For example, Quantcast may pseudonymously identify a device as &ldquo;cookie ID 123.&rdquo; Company B may pseudonymously identify the same device as &ldquo;cookie ID ABC.&rdquo; Cookie Syncing/Matching enables Quantcast and Company B to recognise that their respective <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous identifiers </u></a>may relate to the device that Quantcast records as &ldquo;cookie ID 123&rdquo;.</p><p>Quantcast&rsquo;s Cookie Syncing activities work similarly. If you visit a website that incorporates <a href="#_heading=h.1hmsyys"><u>Pixels, Tags or SDKs</u></a> from Quantcast, Company B may match its own pseudonymous identifiers to Quantcast<a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u> Pseudonymous Identifiers </u></a>(this creates a record of matching pseudonymous identifiers for Company B). Once a match is established, Company B can reference a particular device when communicating with Quantcast, using Quantcast&rsquo;s <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>.</p><p>The Cookie Syncing/Matching process does not in itself result in Quantcast sharing <a href="#_heading=h.1fob9te"><u>Attributes</u></a> related to Quantcast <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers </u></a>with Company B. The Cookie Syncing/Matching enables transactions between the parties at a later time; for example, in the case of an Advertising Exchange sending a Bid Request, the Bid Request can contain a previously synched <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier.</u></a></p><h3><a id="_heading=h.3rdcrjn"></a>Cross-Media Matching/Linking</h3><p>In the online advertising industry, Cross-Media Matching generally refers to a process through which Quantcast links identifiers across a user&rsquo;s consumption of various media (e.g. audio, video, websites, apps, etc) because such identifiers are known to or <a href="#_heading=h.qsh70q"><u>Inferred </u></a>to relate to the same user. Matching/Linking may be undertaken for consumption of media on a single device and for consumption of media on more than one device. As an example, if you visit a digital property using your mobile phone and later visit that same digital property using a browser on your laptop or make visits to several different digital properties using a browser over a period of time, Quantcast may initially determine that these visits are made by different users and assign each device user their own profile.</p><p>If, however, Quantcast finds there is sufficient commonality between the <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> associated with the consumption of media, Quantcast will assess that those identifiers may be joined as they are likely to emanate from the same user. This assessment is&ldquo;probabilistic&rdquo;&ndash; in other words, it uses statistical techniques to determine that the identifiers to be matched have a higher likelihood of relating to the same device and/or user.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.26in1rg"></a>Data Management Platforms and Data Providers</h3><p>Data Management Platforms and Data Providers provide <a href="#_heading=h.nmf14n"><u>Third Party Data</u></a> to Quantcast, or provide a platform through which Clients can provide <a href="#_heading=h.1t3h5sf"><u>Client Data</u></a> to Quantcast. These companies either directly licence first and third party <a href="#_heading=h.3znysh7"><u>Audience</u></a> <a href="#_heading=h.1v1yuxt"><u>Segment Data</u></a> from different sources (such as <a href="#_heading=h.147n2zr"><u>Online Data</u></a> and <a href="#_heading=h.23ckvvd"><u>Offline Data</u></a>) to businesses or provide a platform through which Clients can collect, organise, and activate such data for Quantcast&rsquo;s use in connection with the Solutions. We share <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> with <a href="#_heading=h.26in1rg"><u>Data Management Platforms/Data Providers</u></a> in order to sync/match identifiers to effectively integrate with their services (see <a href="#_heading=h.17dp8vu"><u>Cookie Syncing/Matching</u></a>).</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.lnxbz9"></a>Device ID/Identifier</h3><p>A unique string of characters that can be used to identify a device set by the developer of the device&rsquo;s operating system (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, TV, or console). Device Identifiers (or &ldquo;<strong>Device IDs</strong>&rdquo;) serve a similar purpose as <a href="#_heading=h.4d34og8"><u>Cookies</u></a> and can be used to provide personalised advertising. A Device ID is a <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>.</p><p>A Mobile Advertising ID (or &ldquo;<strong>MAID</strong>&rdquo;) is a Device ID assigned to a mobile device by the mobile device operating system. Typically, the device user can reset or turn off the ID via the device&rsquo;s settings. A MAID is referred to as the IDFA (ID for Advertisers) on iOS devices and GAID (Google Ad ID) on Android mobile devices.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.35nkun2"></a>Device Configuration/Device Information</h3><p>Information about a device or its configuration, transmitted from the device, and typically associated with a <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>. The information includes browser, app, or other information about the device (such as device type, screen size and resolution, date and time, and language), which also may include a<a href="#_heading=h.3j2qqm3"><u> User Agent.</u></a> Some Device Information is derived from <a href="#_heading=h.z337ya"><u>HTTP Request Header Information</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.1ksv4uv"></a>Event Data</h3><p>Information collected relating to your <a href="#_heading=h.147n2zr"><u>Online</u></a> activity/behaviour, which may include<a href="#_heading=h.32hioqz"><u> Personal Information</u></a> in <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a>, <a href="#_heading=h.3whwml4"><u>Imprecise/Approximate Location Information</u></a>, <a href="#_heading=h.z337ya"><u>HTTP Request Header Information</u></a>, <a href="#_heading=h.35nkun2"><u>Device Information</u></a>, <a href="#_heading=h.3dy6vkm"><u>Browsing Data</u></a> and <a href="#_heading=h.46r0co2"><u>TCF Signals</u></a>. Event Data is generated when a <a href="#_heading=h.1hmsyys"><u>Pixel, Tag, or SDK</u></a> installed on a Client&rsquo;s digital property loads and sends information to us. Event Data can also be collected from ads, when you view or click on an ad which contains a <a href="#_heading=h.2u6wntf"><u>Tag</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.44sinio"></a>Exchange/Advertising Exchange</h3><p>A marketplace platform that facilitates automated, real-time, auction-based buying and selling of ad inventory (which are spaces available on sites and apps to display ads). An Advertising Exchange receives <a href="#_heading=h.tyjcwt"><u>Bid Requests</u></a> from digital publishers and forwards them to advertisers, or to entities like Quantcast who act on behalf of advertisers. Advertisers, or their agents, respond to <a href="#_heading=h.tyjcwt"><u>Bid Requests</u></a> with a bid amount and an advertisement to provide to a user if they win the auction.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.2jxsxqh"></a>First Party Cookie</h3><p>See <a href="#_heading=h.4d34og8"><u>Cookie</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.z337ya"></a>HTTP Request Header Information</h3><p>HTTP headers are defined by internet standards and contain a number of data fields designed to facilitate communication and interoperability on the internet. On the web, your web browser controls which headers are sent and what the contents are. We receive the headers when a request is sent over the internet to our system, such as when a <a href="#_heading=h.1hmsyys"><u>Pixel</u></a> loads in your web browser. We also might receive information that has been derived from the HTTP headers from another party, such as in a <a href="#_heading=h.tyjcwt"><u>Bid Request</u></a>.

Imported Data is <a href="#_heading=h.3fwokq0"><u>Pseudonymised Information</u></a>, which may include information relating to your <a href="#_heading=h.147n2zr"><u>Online data</u></a> or <a href="#_heading=h.23ckvvd"><u>Offline data</u></a> or other information that Clients or partners have about you. For examples of Imported Data provided to Quantcast, see <a href="#_heading=h.1t3h5sf"><u>Client Data</u></a> or <a href="#_heading=h.nmf14n"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.2xcytpi"></a>Imported Data (Client)</h3><p>See <a href="#_heading=h.1t3h5sf"><u>Client Data</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.1ci93xb"></a>Imported Data (Third Party/Segment)</h3><p>See <a href="#_heading=h.nmf14n"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.3whwml4"></a>Imprecise/Approximate Location Information</h3><p>Typically, in digital advertising we distinguish between precise and imprecise geolocation information.</p><p>Precise geolocation usually comes from GPS coordinates from mobile devices, and can have precision up to about one metre. Quantcast does not use precise geolocation data and we request that Clients, partners, and third parties refrain from sending precise geolocation to us. If a party inadvertently sends it, we do not use it in the Solutions and it is removed from our systems within 30 days.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.2bn6wsx"></a>Imprecise geolocation is lower precision, and refers to a general geographic area, for example a country, region, city or division of a metropolitan area, and/or some combination of these, and is often derived from GPS coordinates or from <a href="#_heading=h.1pxezwc"><u>IP Addresses</u></a>.</h3><h3><a id="_heading=h.qsh70q"></a>Inferences/Inferred Data</h3><p>Inferences, or Inferred Data, is information that is inferred from data that we have collected about a device, such as <a href="#_heading=h.1ksv4uv"><u>Event Data</u></a>, <a href="#_heading=h.tyjcwt"><u>Bid Request Data</u></a>,<a href="#_heading=h.1t3h5sf"><u> Client Data</u></a>, or <a href="#_heading=h.nmf14n"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>. Our inferences are made using algorithms that estimate the likelihood that the user of a device has particular interests or characteristics. The Inferences are then associated with a <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> as part of a set of device <a href="#_heading=h.1fob9te"><u>Attributes</u></a>.</p><p>For example, if a device frequently visits sports websites, it might be inferred that there is some probability the user of that device likes sports. Similarly, if a device frequently visits an airline provider&rsquo;s website, it might be inferred that there is some probability a user of that device likes to travel. Other Inferences include things such as <a href="#_heading=h.3as4poj"><u>Interests</u></a>, income range, gender, age, marital status, and other socio-economic information.</p><p>Inferences associated with any individual device have a high degree of uncertainty. Inferences become more accurate when used to estimate the characteristics of a large group of devices, like an <a href="#_heading=h.3znysh7"><u>Audience</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.3as4poj"></a>Interests</h3><p>Interests are known, observed, or inferred non-demographic characteristics. Interests are associated with <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> to characterise particular interests of users. Examples of Interests include &ldquo;cooking&rdquo; and &ldquo;outdoor activities&rdquo;. Interests may be derived from <a href="#_heading=h.1ksv4uv"><u>Event Data</u></a>, <a href="#_heading=h.tyjcwt"><u>Bid Request Data</u></a>, <a href="#_heading=h.1t3h5sf"><u>Client Data</u></a>, <a href="#_heading=h.nmf14n"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>, and <a href="#_heading=h.qsh70q"><u>Inferences/Inferred Data</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.1pxezwc"></a>IP Address</h3><p>An IP (&ldquo;<strong>Internet Protocol</strong>&rdquo;) Address is a unique numerical label corresponding to a computer or device. Computers use IP Addresses to identify each other and know where to send information over the Internet. For example, when you open a web page in your browser a request is made to a server for the web page content. The server knows where to send the content based on the IP Address contained in the request. Computers or other devices are assigned an IP Address from the network the device is on. A device&rsquo;s IP Address may change over time or as a device changes locations. Also, an IP Address can refer to multiple devices, for example if the devices are behind an internet router.</p><p>An IP Address that has been hashed, or encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email, is treated as a <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.49x2ik5"></a>Labels/Label Data</h3><p>Labels, or Label Data, are descriptors associated with <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> to denote particular groups of users that can be subsequently used to index all <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> associated with that label. An analogy would be applying a &ldquo;label&rdquo; to messages in an email inbox - you might decide to label messages from work as &ldquo;Work&rdquo;, family members as &ldquo;Family,&rdquo; and so on. These labels then help you readily index and recall particular categories of email.</p><p>Labels processed by Quantcast are:</p><ul><li>Labels from <a href="#_heading=h.26in1rg"><u>Data Management Platforms and Data Providers</u></a> : these are category Labels (e.g., male, female, age 21-24) acquired from third party data partners relating to a <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>;</li><li>Custom-<a href="#_heading=h.1t3h5sf"><u>Client Data</u></a> Labels: these are custom category labels set by Clients corresponding to a device associated with the identifier visiting their digital property (e.g., byline of the news article accessed by the user) or product name (of the product accessed by the user).</li><li><a href="#_heading=h.qsh70q"><u>Inferred Data</u></a> Labels: these are inferred category Labels about a user using a device associated with a <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a>, e.g., inferred age, inferred gender, inferred interest.</li></ul><p>Example Labels are &ldquo;male&rdquo; and &ldquo;visited XYZ website&rdquo;. Labels may be inferred information (see <a href="#_heading=h.qsh70q"><u>Inferences/Inferred Data</u></a>) or may be<a href="#_heading=h.4i7ojhp"><u> Imported Data</u></a> (see <a href="#_heading=h.1t3h5sf"><u>Client Data</u></a> and <a href="#_heading=h.nmf14n"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>).</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.2p2csry"></a>Log Data</h3><p>Log Data is an industry term that is generally used to refer to data collected from interactions with computer systems, and is used differently by different companies. For purposes of describing our <a href="#_heading=h.2grqrue"><u>Processing</u></a>, we use more precise terms, such as <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a>, <a href="#_heading=h.1ksv4uv"><u>Event Data</u></a>, <a href="#_heading=h.tyjcwt"><u>Bid Request Data</u></a>, <a href="#_heading=h.1t3h5sf"><u>Client Data</u></a>, <a href="#_heading=h.nmf14n"><u>Third Party Data</u></a>, and/or <a href="#_heading=h.qsh70q"><u>Inferences/Inferred Data</u></a>, which are all types of data that can be subsumed within the general industry term &ldquo;Log Data&rdquo;. Some elements within Log Data, when isolated from the <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a>, will not qualify as <a href="#_heading=h.32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a>. For example, a single time zone and publisher <a href="#_heading=h.1mrcu09"><u>URL</u></a> without an associated <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifier </u></a>would not qualify as <a href="#_heading=h.32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.147n2zr"></a>Online Data</h3><h3><a id="_heading=h.3o7alnk"></a>Data relating to a user&rsquo;s interaction with digital media including websites, apps and streaming media services.</h3><h3><a id="_heading=h.23ckvvd"></a>Offline Data</h3><p>Data relating to a user&rsquo;s real-world purchases and/or activity.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.ihv636"></a>Panel</h3><p>A Panel is a set of individuals who have consented to participate in market research and share information about themselves, their preferences and interests for purposes of research and market analytics.</p><p>This information can then be used as the basis for learning or making inferences about a larger population. For example, if a number of people on a Panel share that they visit a particular news website, and of those people, most of them are male and over the age of 50, we might extrapolate from that and say that most of the audience for that website is male and over 50.</p><p>Another way to use Panel data is to compare Panel results to the estimates that we have made using our algorithms in order to score the effectiveness of our algorithms. So, if our algorithm predicted for the same news website that most of the audience is under 30, we would learn that our algorithm might be wrong.</p><h3 id="Personal-Information"><a id="_heading=h.32hioqz"></a>Personal Information</h3><p>Personal Information refers to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to you, your browser, or your device. We use the term &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; to refer to information that is subject to protection under data protection and privacy laws and regulatory regimes around the world. Depending on the jurisdiction, such information may be referred to as &ldquo;personal data.&rdquo;</p><p>The Personal Information <a href="#_heading=h.2grqrue"><u>Processed </u></a>by Quantcast is limited to <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymised Identifiers.</u></a> Quantcast does not <a href="#_heading=h.2grqrue"><u>Process</u></a> <a href="#_heading=h.32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a> that directly identifies you as an individual, and that can be used to directly identify you without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.1hmsyys"></a>Pixels, Tags, and SDKs</h3><p>Pixels, Tags, and SDKs are computer code embedded in a website that we use to enable the Solutions. We tend to use the terms Pixels, Tags, and SDKs interchangeably. Clients that use the Solutions can put them on their sites, in their apps, or in their ads in order to send us information that is then used in the Solutions. When a Pixel, Tag, or SDK loads and calls our servers, we receive <a href="#_heading=h.z337ya"><u>HTTP Header Information</u></a>, along with other information that is configured by the Client who is using the Solutions. That information includes IDs from partners, so we know which partner the data is coming from.</p><p>Pixels, Tags, and SDKs include:</p><ul><li>Sync Pixels: These are used to exchange and match <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> between companies that participate in the digital advertising market. By matching, they can synchronise these identifiers to deliver and measure ads.</li><li>Tags or Pixels in ads: When a digital ad loads on a page, it can include a Tag or Pixel that we use on behalf of Clients to gather information about where and when the ad was served. This can help to measure ad performance, to ensure ads are shown where intended, and to learn in order to improve ad effectiveness.</li><li>Tags or Pixels on publisher Clients&rsquo; web pages: For publisher Clients that use the Solutions, they can put our Tags on their sites. The information we collect then enables the Client to learn about their audience, and it enables us to build models for better targeting ads.</li><li>Tags or Pixels used by advertiser Clients: When advertiser Clients use our Tags or Pixels, they send us information so we can learn about their customers in order to help them better target their ads.</li><li>SDKs: SDKs are bits of computer code that mobile app publisher Clients incorporate into their apps, enabling them to send us information. Similar to Pixels or Tags, the information enables us to offer the Solutions as described in our Privacy Policy.</li></ul><h3><a id="_heading=h.41mghml"></a>Probabilistic Identifier</h3><p>A Probabilistic Identifier is a<a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u> Pseudonymous Identifier</u></a> which we create by combining <a href="#_heading=h.vx1227"><u>Pseudonymous Identifiers</u></a> (such as <a href="#_heading=h.1pxezwc"><u>IP Addresses</u></a>) with <a href="#_heading=h.tyjcwt"><u>Bid Request Data</u></a> and/or <a href="#_heading=h.1ksv4uv"><u>Event Data</u></a> using non-deterministic, statistical methods to estimate the likelihood that a group of devices may be used by the same user or household, if applicable law or rules allow. For example, we might be able to determine that because a mobile phone and a TV are on the same network, they are likely in the same house. We can then use that information to select and measure ads. Unlike using <a href="#_heading=h.2s8eyo1"><u>Cookie IDs</u></a>, this approach is not 100% accurate and could identify one or many devices.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.2grqrue"></a>Process</h3><p>Refers to any operation or set of operations performed upon <a href="#_heading=h.32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a> or sets of <a href="#_heading=h.32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a>, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.vx1227"></a>Pseudonymous Identifiers</h3><p>Pseudonymous Identifiers are unique values that distinguish your browser profile(s) or device(s). Pseudonymous Identifiers cannot be linked to you as an individual without technical efforts to add additional information, which Quantcast does not have. We do not attempt to link Pseudonymous Identifiers to you as an individual, and we prohibit other parties with whom we share Pseudonymous Identifiers from doing the same.</p><p><br /></p><p>Pseudonymous Identifiers are important in digital advertising because they help distinguish browsers or devices over time across different contexts. This is useful for example, to limit the number of times that we show the same ad to one device, to measure the performance of ads, and to target and select personalised ads.</p><p>We may incorporate any one of the following types of information in a Quantcast Pseudonymous Identifier:</p><ul><li>Third Party Cookie ID: see <a href="#_heading=h.2s8eyo1"><u>Cookie ID</u></a>.</li><li>First Party Cookie ID: see <a href="#_heading=h.2s8eyo1"><u>Cookie ID</u></a>.</li><li><a href="#_heading=h.1pxezwc"><u>IP Addresses</u></a>.</li><li>Hashed email addresses, which are email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email.</li><li><a href="#_heading=h.lnxbz9"><u>Device ID</u></a>.</li><li>Application ID: an ID that is unique to your mobile device and a particular app on your device.</li><li>Application Session ID: like an application ID, except that it is reset periodically (e.g., many browsers reset these after 30 minutes of inactivity).</li><li>Exchange User ID: an ID that is sent to us with a <a href="#_heading=h.tyjcwt"><u>Bid Request</u></a> that identifies the device or browser where an ad is to be shown.</li><li><a href="#_heading=h.41mghml"><u>Probabilistic Identifier</u></a>.</li><li>Publisher User ID: digital publishers that use the Solutions can send us an ID to use in the Solutions. The digital publisher hashes or encrypts an identifier available to it. The resulting ID is pseudonymous because it does not directly identify you, but it would be consistent across different publishers, so the Publisher User ID can be used to match data.</li><li>TLS Session ID: when you visit a website <a href="#_heading=h.1mrcu09"><u>URL</u></a> that starts with &ldquo;https&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;http&rdquo;, that means you have an encrypted connection between your browser and the site. If one of our <a href="#_heading=h.1hmsyys"><u>Pixels, Tags or SDKs</u></a> loads on the site, that call to our server will also be encrypted. The Session ID identifies a particular session of communication between the browser and the server.</li></ul><h3><a id="_heading=h.3fwokq0"></a>Pseudonymous/Pseudonymised Information</h3><p>Pseudonymised Information is <a href="#_heading=h.32hioqz"><u>Personal Information</u></a> that has been <a href="#_heading=h.2grqrue"><u>Processed</u></a> in such a manner that the information can no longer be attributed to a specific user without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal information is not attributed to a specific user.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.1v1yuxt"></a>Segment Data</h3><p>Segment Data is imported data that is uploaded to the Quantcast platform or provided to us via an API by <a href="#_heading=h.1t3h5sf"><u>Clients</u></a> or <a href="#_heading=h.nmf14n"><u>Third Party Data Partners</u></a>.

This category of information is typically called &ldquo;Segment Data&rdquo; because it identifies groups of users who fall into advertising segments (e.g., &ldquo;auto buyers,&rdquo; &ldquo;shoe shoppers,&rdquo; or &ldquo;women 25-35&rdquo;). These segments represent groups of users that share (or that are inferred to share) one or more certain characteristics in common (e.g., a client may want to advertise to a segment of &ldquo;male shoppers who are interested in sports fashion&rdquo;). These groupings are created by using the intersection of different segments (in the example given, an audience that is simultaneously in the &ldquo;male&rdquo;, &ldquo;shopper&rdquo;, and &ldquo;sports fashion&rdquo; segments). A segment may be identified with a <a href="#_heading=h.49x2ik5"><u>Label </u></a>(in which case it is referred to as &ldquo;<a href="#_heading=h.49x2ik5"><u>Label Data</u></a>&rdquo;).</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.4f1mdlm"></a>Software Development Kit (SDK)</h3><p>See <a href="#_heading=h.1hmsyys"><u>Pixels, Tags, and SDKs</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.2u6wntf"></a>Tag</h3><p>See <a href="#_heading=h.1hmsyys"><u>Pixels, Tags, and SDKs</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.19c6y18"></a>TCF</h3><p>See <a href="#_heading=h.1y810tw"><u>IAB Transparency & Consent Framework</u></a>.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.3tbugp1"></a>TCF Purpose/TCF Special Purpose</h3><p>The <a href="#_heading=h.19c6y18"><u>TCF </u></a>has standardised certain Purposes, Special Purposes and Special Features and the descriptions of data processing activity in the digital advertising industry.

                        <p><strong>Last Update: May 16, 2023</strong></p><p>This Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Publisher Partners is for Quantcast publisher partners and clients (&ldquo;publishers&rdquo;) who include Quantcast code, such as pixels or tags, on their websites for Quantcast Measure or the Quantcast QID Module in Prebid. It documents certain privacy-related responsibilities for publishers, which are in addition to the <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum" target="_blank">US Data Privacy Addendum</a> (the &ldquo;DPA&rdquo;). If there is any conflict between this document and the DPA, the DPA is the controlling document.</p><p>Privacy regulation around the world is dynamic. Quantcast may update this document from time to time at its own discretion in order to keep pace with changes in privacy rules and risks, and industry best practices, as well as to ensure users&rsquo; rights are honored appropriately. </p><p>Quantcast may take reasonable measures to ensure that data processed in its services is collected and processed in accordance with privacy rules and industry best practices. We may review locations where data is collected and may refuse to accept data that is not collected in a manner consistent with the approaches described in this document.  </p><p>This document does not contain legal advice, and adherence to this document does not ensure legal compliance. Publishers must ensure for themselves that they operate in a legal manner, based on their particular circumstances. In the event of any conflict between this document and applicable laws or regulations, the laws or regulations should prevail.</p><p><u>Terminology</u></p><p>This document uses &ldquo;user&rdquo; or &ldquo;users&rdquo; as interchangeable with &ldquo;data subject&rdquo; or &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; or other equivalent terms from various rules. </p><p>When we say rules, we mean laws, regulations, and industry self-regulatory codes that are applicable to the processing of personal data in relation to Quantcast&rsquo;s services. Quantcast has a global footprint, including operations in the EU, the UK, and the US (including California), so those jurisdictions&rsquo; rules are applicable to Quantcast for data about users who reside in those jurisdictions.  </p><p>We also will use &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; as interchangeable with terms such as, &ldquo;personal information.&rdquo; Personal data processed by Quantcast&rsquo;s service is pseudonymous, including but not limited to IP address, cookie or device IDs, and other identifiers used for advertising-related purposes. In the case where a publisher has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.</p><p><u>Industry standards and self-regulatory programs</u></p><p>Quantcast supports and participates in industry self-regulatory programs, and generally implements industry standards and best practices when it comes to handling personal data. Publishers are responsible for ensuring their own implementation of self-regulatory rules and industry best practices, in particular related to providing transparency and choice to users in places where data is collected or used by Quantcast&rsquo;s services. </p><p><u>Controller, processor, service provider, vendor, etc.</u></p><p>Unfortunately, terms used across jurisdictions that describe the relationships between parties sharing data are not interchangeable. Quantcast determines its role based on applicable law and the facts of its processing of personal data.</p><p>Where the EU GDPR or the UK GDPR applies, Quantcast is a &ldquo;controller&rdquo; of personal data collected using Quantcast tags and pixels dropped on your sites. This document, together with the Quantcast agreement under which you access our services, addresses our respective GDPR compliance responsibilities. Where US state privacy law applies, Quantcast acts as a &ldquo;third party&rdquo; unless agreed otherwise.</p><p><u>Notice/Transparency and Choice</u></p><p>Laws, self-regulatory rules, and industry best practice require users be notified about processing of personal data, and be offered a choice &ndash; either opt in or opt out &mdash; with respect to that processing. </p><p>When deploying Quantcast tags or pixels, including Quantcast Measure tags and the QID prebid module, publishers are responsible to make sure that users are given notice and choice that is required for Quantcast to be able to collect and process the data. And, of course, publishers have to make sure of notice and choice for their own collection and processing of personal data.</p><p>At minimum, and further subject to any other applicable laws or rules, notice must include the fact that third parties are collecting and processing users&rsquo; data, along with information about the data collected, the means of collection, the purposes for processing (including interest-based advertising and advertising measurement), and how users can exercise their choices. Laws or rules in some jurisdictions, including the EU and the UK, would require that Quantcast be specifically identified in the notice, and a link to Quantcast&rsquo;s <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#products-and-services-privacy-policy">privacy policy</a> be included. </p><p>Quantcast&rsquo;s methods of collection include, depending on particular circumstances, cookies, pixels, JavaScript tags, probabilistic device matching, and cross-device matching (using passively collected data). The data Quantcast collects includes information about users&rsquo; visits to sites, such as IP address, device information, timestamp, referrer URL, etc. </p><p>Quantcast implements choice using industry standard methods, and will be responsible for honoring that choice with respect to personal data within Quantcast&rsquo;s services. </p><p>For their part, publishers need to provide access to the choice using industry standard and legally compliant methods, depending on the applicable laws and rules. Publishers should, at minimum, and subject to any additional legal requirements provide a link to the geographically relevant industry opt-out page, including but not limited to <a href="https://youradchoices.com/" target="_blank">YourAdChoices</a> and the <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" target="_blank">NAI</a> in the US, <a href="https://youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank">Your Online Choices</a> in Europe, and <a href="https://youradchoices.ca/" target="_blank">Your Ad Choices</a> in Canada.</p><p>In all cases, publishers should have user-facing privacy policies that are prominently linked from their homepages and from content (sites, apps, etc.) where personal data are collected or used. </p><p>Privacy policies will adhere to applicable laws, as well as industry self-regulatory requirements and industry best practices. At minimum, policies should disclose the fact that third parties are collecting personal data for advertising-related purposes, and should describe the methods of collection, as described above. Particular circumstances and applicable rules may create additional requirements.</p><p>Where consent (opt-in) is required prior to setting cookies or collecting data, such as in Europe under ePrivacy, the GDPR, and the UK GDPR, publishers are responsible to make sure that tags or pixels don&rsquo;t fire until that consent is obtained. Publishers must not send to Quantcast, or enable Quantcast to collect, personal data without having established required permissions, and certainly not if the user has explicitly opted out.</p><p><strong>EU and the UK</strong>: The industry standard means for ensuring notice and choice for vendors like Quantcast in the EU and the UK is the IAB Transparency and Consent Framework. Quantcast is vendor ID 11. Quantcast&rsquo;s required purposes and associated legal bases are viewable in the Global Vendor List. Because Quantcast is subject to European law, the TCF should be used for all users in the EU or the UK, even if the publisher has no operations in Europe. Alternatively, such publishers may elect not to introduce data about EU or UK users into Quantcast&rsquo;s services. Quantcast Choice is a leading, and TCF compliant, Consent Management Platform. Proper use of Quantcast Choice will meet these TCF requirements.</p><p>Publishers not using the TCF for EU or UK users may, only with Quantcast&rsquo;s express written permission, use a legally compliant alternative means to ensure Quantcast&rsquo;s legal basis for using cookies, where applicable, and for processing the data. This includes that Quantcast must be identified as a controller of the user&rsquo;s personal data, and a link to Quantcast&rsquo;s privacy policy must be provided. Quantcast may in the future require TCF. In any case, publishers should not allow data to be collected by, or transmitted to, Quantcast on their sites without user consent, and must be able to provide proof of consent to Quantcast, upon request. </p><p>Privacy policies in the EU and the UK need to include a link to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) opt-out page, located at youronlinechoices.com.</p><p><strong>US</strong>: In the US, along with other requirements laid out here, privacy policies need to include links to an industry standard opt out page, like those offered by the NAI or DAA. </p><p><strong>California</strong>: The CCPA applies for users in California. Publishers need to provide users with notice of their &ldquo;sale&rdquo; and &ldquo;share&rdquo; opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable. Unless agreed otherwise with Quantcast, Quantcast acts as a &ldquo;third-party,&rdquo; as defined under the CCPA, with respect to personal data it collects or receives from publishers&rsquo; sites. Quantcast will check the US Privacy String, <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/standards/ccpa/">as specified by the IAB</a>.</p><p><strong>Other US states:</strong> Applicable state privacy law applies for users in Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Virginia and elsewhere. Publishers need to provide users with notice of their &ldquo;sale&rdquo; and &ldquo;targeted advertising&rdquo; opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable. </p><p><strong>US State Privacy Addendum</strong>: The processing of US users&rsquo; personal data in connection with Quantcast&rsquo;s services shall be governed by the US Data Privacy Addendum, <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum" target="_blank">which is available here</a>.</p><p><u>Access and Deletion</u></p><p>Under applicable law, including the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR, and the US state privacy laws, when acting as a controller or third party, Quantcast will be responsible for honoring users&rsquo; access and deletion requests with respect to their personal data that is within Quantcast&rsquo;s services. </p><p><u>Other Matters</u></p><p><strong>Sensitive data</strong>. Because Quantcast&rsquo;s services are not intended for processing data regarded as &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; or &ldquo;special category data&rdquo; under applicable law or data about children under the age of 16, publishers must not transmit to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect any such data. Quantcast tags and pixels may not be deployed on content that is directed at children under the age of 16. Sensitive or special category data includes the types of data listed in Article 9 of the EU GDPR, Section 1798.140 of the CCPA (as amended by the CPRA), or any equivalent term under applicable law.</p><p><strong>Directly identifying personal data</strong>. Quantcast&rsquo;s services are not designed to process directly identifying personal data, such as names or email addresses, and publishers may not send such information to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect it. If a publisher has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.</p><p><strong>Reidentification</strong>. Under no circumstances will publishers use any information collected or generated by Quantcast&rsquo;s services to identify an individual user. </p>

Quantcast determines its role based on applicable law and the facts of its processing of personal data. In many relationships with advertiser partners or clients, Quantcast is a controller or joint controller, because of the role that Quantcast plays in defining exactly how data is used. This does not mean Quantcast has unfettered rights to use this data; rather, Quantcast&rsquo;s use of the data is usually restricted by contractual limitations. If you have questions about this, please consult your agreement or ask your account representative.</p><p>Advertisers: Where the EU GDPR or the UK GDPR applies, Quantcast is a joint controller of personal data collected using Quantcast tags and pixels and of other personal data introduced into Quantcast&rsquo;s services by the advertiser.

Quantcast tags and pixels may not be deployed on content that is directed at children under the age of 16.

                        <p>This Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Advertiser Partners documents certain privacy-related responsibilities for advertisers and agencies, which are in addition to the <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum"><u>US State Data Privacy Addendum</u></a> and the <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#international-data-privacy-addendum"><u>International Data Privacy Addendum</u></a> (collectively, the &ldquo;DPAs&rdquo;). If there is any conflict between this document and the DPAs, the DPAs are the controlling documents.</p><p>Privacy regulation around the world is dynamic. Quantcast may update this document from time to time at its own discretion in order to keep pace with changes in privacy rules and risks, and industry best practices, as well as to ensure users&rsquo; rights are honored appropriately.</p><p>Quantcast may take reasonable measures to ensure that data processed in its services is collected and processed in accordance with privacy rules and industry best practices. We may review locations where data is collected and may refuse to accept data that is not collected in a manner consistent with the approaches described in this document.</p><p><u>Terminology</u></p><p>This document uses &ldquo;user&rdquo; or &ldquo;users&rdquo; as interchangeable with &ldquo;data subject&rdquo; or &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; or other equivalent terms from various rules.</p><p>When we say rules, we mean laws, regulations, and industry self-regulatory codes that are applicable to the processing of personal data in relation to Quantcast&rsquo;s services. Quantcast has a global footprint, including operations in the EU, the UK, and the US (including California), so those jurisdictions&rsquo; rules are applicable to Quantcast for data about users who reside in those jurisdictions.</p><p>We also will use &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; as interchangeable with terms such as, &ldquo;personal information.&rdquo; Personal data processed by Quantcast&rsquo;s service is pseudonymous, including but not limited to IP address, cookie or device IDs, and other identifiers used for advertising-related purposes. In the case where a partner has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.</p><p><u>Industry standards and self-regulatory programs</u></p><p>Quantcast supports and participates in industry self-regulatory programs, and generally implements industry standards and best practices when it comes to handling personal data. Partners and clients are responsible for ensuring their own implementation of self- regulatory rules and industry best practices, in particular related to providing transparency and choice to users in places where data is collected or used by Quantcast&rsquo;s services.</p><p><u>Controller, processor, service provider, vendor, etc</u>.</p><p>Unfortunately, terms describing the relationships between parties sharing data are not interchangeable. Quantcast determines its role based on applicable law and the facts of its processing of personal data. In many relationships with advertiser partners or clients, Quantcast is a controller or joint controller, because of the role that Quantcast plays in defining exactly how data is used. This does not mean Quantcast has unfettered rights to use this data; rather, Quantcast&rsquo;s use of the data is usually restricted by contractual limitations. If you have questions about this, please consult your agreement or ask your account representative.</p><p>Advertisers: Where the EU GDPR or the UK GDPR applies, Quantcast is a joint controller of personal data collected using Quantcast tags and pixels and of other personal data introduced into Quantcast&rsquo;s services by the advertiser. Where US state privacy law applies, Quantcast acts as a &ldquo;third party.&rdquo;</p><p><u>Notice/Transparency and Choice</u></p><p>Laws, self-regulatory rules, and industry best practice require users be notified about processing of personal data, and be offered a choice &ndash; either opt in or opt out &mdash; with respect to that processing.</p><p>When deploying Quantcast tags or pixels, or otherwise introducing data into Quantcast&rsquo;s services, partners and clients are responsible to make sure that users are given notice and choice that is required for Quantcast to be able to collect and process the data. And, of course, partners and clients have to make sure of notice and choice for their own personal data collection and processing.</p><p>Generally, notice must include the fact that third parties are collecting and processing users&rsquo; data, along with information about the data collected, the means of collection, the purposes for processing (including interest-based advertising), and how users can exercise their choices. Laws or rules in some jurisdictions would require that Quantcast be specifically identified in the notice and a link to Quantcast&rsquo;s <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#products-and-services-privacy-policy"><u>privacy policy</u></a> be included.</p><p>Quantcast&rsquo;s methods of collection include, depending on particular circumstances, cookies, pixels, JavaScript tags, probabilistic device matching and cross-device matching (using passively collected data).</p><p>Quantcast implements choice using industry standard methods and will be responsible for honoring that choice with respect to personal data within Quantcast&rsquo;s services.</p><p>For their part, partners and clients need to provide access to the choice using industry standard and legally compliant methods, depending on the applicable laws and rules. Usually this means providing access to choose within other privacy disclosures, including in a privacy policy.</p><p>In all cases, partners and clients should have user-facing privacy policies that are prominently linked from their homepages and from content (sites, apps, etc.) where personal data are collected or used.</p><p>Privacy policies will adhere to applicable laws, as well as industry self-regulatory requirements and industry best practices. At minimum, policies should disclose the fact that third parties are collecting personal data for advertising-related purposes, and should describe the methods of collection, as described above. Particular circumstances and applicable rules may create additional requirements.</p><p>Where consent (opt-in) is required prior to setting cookies or collecting data, such as in Europe under ePrivacy, the GDPR, and the UK GDPR, partners and clients are responsible to make sure that tags or pixels don&rsquo;t fire until that consent is obtained.</p><p>EU and the UK: The industry standard means for ensuring notice and choice for vendors like Quantcast in the EU and the UK is the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework. Quantcast is vendor ID 11. Quantcast&rsquo;s required purposes and associated legal bases are viewable in the Global Vendor List. Because Quantcast is subject to European law, the TCF should be used for all users in the EU or the UK, even if the client or partner has no operations in Europe. Alternatively, such partners and clients may elect not to introduce data about EU or UK users into Quantcast&rsquo;s services. Quantcast Choice is a leading, and TCF compliant, Consent Management Platform.</p><p>Proper use of Quantcast Choice will meet these requirements.</p><p>Partners and clients not using the TCF for EU or UK users need to use a legally compliant alternative means to ensure Quantcast&rsquo;s legal basis for using cookies, where applicable, and for processing the data. This includes that Quantcast must be identified as a controller of the user&rsquo;s personal data, and a link to Quantcast&rsquo;s privacy policy must be provided. Quantcast may in the future require TCF.</p><p>Privacy policies in the EU and the UK need to include a link to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) opt out page, located at youronlinechoices.com.</p><p>US: In the US, along with other requirements laid out here, privacy policies need to include links to an industry standard opt out page, like those offered by the NAI or DAA.</p><p>California: The CCPA applies for users in California. Partners and clients need to provide users with notice of their &ldquo;sale&rdquo; and &ldquo;share&rdquo; opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable.</p><p>Other US states: Applicable state privacy law applies for users in Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia. Partners and clients need to provide users with notice of their &ldquo;sale&rdquo; and &ldquo;targeted advertising&rdquo; opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable.</p><p>US State Privacy Addendum: The processing of US users&rsquo; personal data in connection with Quantcast&rsquo;s services shall be governed by the US State Privacy Addendum, <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum"><u>which is available here</u></a>.</p><p><u>Access and Deletion</u></p><p>Under applicable law, including the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR, and the US state privacy laws, as a joint controller or third party, Quantcast will be responsible for providing users access to their personal data that is within Quantcast&rsquo;s services, and for deleting personal data after it receives (or is notified of) a user&rsquo;s request.</p><p><u>Other Matters</u></p><p>Sensitive data. Because Quantcast&rsquo;s services are not intended for processing data regarded as &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; or &ldquo;special category&rdquo; under applicable law (including data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, or parties, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or related to health status or treatment) or data about children under the age of 16, partners and clients must not transmit to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect any such data. Quantcast tags and pixels may not be deployed on content that is directed at children under the age of 16. Sensitive or special category data includes the types of data listed in Article 9 of the EU GDPR, Section 1798.140 of the CCPA (as amended by the CPRA), or any equivalent term under applicable law. Sensitive data also includes any data that qualifies as &ldquo;consumer health data&rdquo; under the Washington My Health My Data Act, 2023 Wash. Laws 191 or any other equivalent laws.</p><p>Directly identifying personal data. Quantcast&rsquo;s services are not designed to process directly identifying personal data, such as names or email addresses, and partners and clients may not send such information to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect it. If a partner has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.</p><p>Reidentification. Under no circumstances will clients and other partners use any information collected or generated by Quantcast&rsquo;s services to identify an individual user.</p>

Particular circumstances and applicable rules may create additional requirements.</p><p>Where consent (opt-in) is required prior to setting cookies or collecting data, such as in Europe under ePrivacy, the GDPR, and the UK GDPR, partners and clients are responsible to make sure that tags or pixels don&rsquo;t fire until that consent is obtained. </p><p><strong>EU and the UK: </strong>The industry standard means for ensuring notice and choice for vendors like Quantcast in the EU and the UK is the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework. Quantcast is vendor ID 11. Quantcast&rsquo;s required purposes and associated legal bases are viewable in the Global Vendor List. Because Quantcast is subject to European law, the TCF should be used for all users in the EU or the UK, even if the client or partner has no operations in Europe. Alternatively, such partners and clients may elect not to introduce data about EU or UK users into Quantcast&rsquo;s services. Quantcast Choice is a leading, and TCF compliant, Consent Management Platform. Proper use of Quantcast Choice will meet these requirements.</p><p>Partners and clients not using the TCF for EU or UK users need to use a legally compliant alternative means to ensure Quantcast&rsquo;s legal basis for using cookies, where applicable, and for processing the data. This includes that Quantcast must be identified as a controller of the user&rsquo;s personal data, and a link to Quantcast&rsquo;s privacy policy must be provided. Quantcast may in the future require TCF. </p><p>Privacy policies in the EU and the UK need to include a link to the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) opt out page, located at youronlinechoices.com.</p><p><strong>US</strong>: In the US, along with other requirements laid out here, privacy policies need to include links to an industry standard opt out page, like those offered by the NAI or DAA. </p><p><strong>California</strong>: The CCPA applies for users in California. Partners and clients need to provide users with notice of their &ldquo;sale&rdquo; and &ldquo;share&rdquo; opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable.</p><p><strong>Other US states</strong>: Applicable state privacy law applies for users in Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia. Partners and clients need to provide users with notice of their &ldquo;sale&rdquo; and &ldquo;targeted advertising&rdquo; opt-out rights and the ability to exercise such rights, as applicable. </p><p><strong>US State Privacy Addendum: </strong>The processing of US users&rsquo; personal data in connection with Quantcast&rsquo;s services shall be governed by the US State Privacy Addendum, <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum" target="_blank">which is available here</a>.</p><p><u>Access and Deletion</u></p><p>Under applicable law, including the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR, and the US state privacy laws, as a joint controller or third party, Quantcast will be responsible for providing users access to their personal data that is within Quantcast&rsquo;s services, and for deleting personal data after it receives (or is notified of) a user&rsquo;s request.</p><p><u>Other Matters</u></p><p><strong>Sensitive data</strong>. Because Quantcast&rsquo;s services are not intended for processing data regarded as &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; or &ldquo;special category&rdquo; under applicable law or data about children under the age of 16, partners and clients must not transmit to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect any such data. Quantcast tags and pixels may not be deployed on content that is directed at children under the age of 16. Sensitive or special category data includes the types of data listed in Article 9 of the EU GDPR, Section 1798.140 of the CCPA (as amended by the CPRA), or any equivalent term under applicable law. </p><p><strong>Directly identifying personal data</strong>. Quantcast&rsquo;s services are not designed to process directly identifying personal data, such as names or email addresses, and partners and clients may not send such information to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect it. If a partner has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.</p><p><strong>Reidentification</strong>. Under no circumstances will publishers use any information collected or generated by Quantcast&rsquo;s services to identify an individual user. </p>

                        <p><strong>Last Update: May 16, 2023</strong></p><p>This Privacy Implementation for Quantcast Advertiser Partners documents certain privacy-related responsibilities for advertisers and agencies, which are in addition to the <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#us-data-privacy-addendum" target="_blank">US State Data Privacy Addendum</a> and the <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#eea-uk-swiss-data-privacy-addendum" target="_blank">EEA/UK/Swiss Data Privacy Addendum</a> (collectively, the &ldquo;DPAs&rdquo;). If there is any conflict between this document and the DPAs, the DPAs are the controlling documents.</p><p>Privacy regulation around the world is dynamic. Quantcast may update this document from time to time at its own discretion in order to keep pace with changes in privacy rules and risks, and industry best practices, as well as to ensure users&rsquo; rights are honored appropriately. </p><p>Quantcast may take reasonable measures to ensure that data processed in its services is collected and processed in accordance with privacy rules and industry best practices. We may review locations where data is collected and may refuse to accept data that is not collected in a manner consistent with the approaches described in this document.  </p><p><u>Terminology</u></p><p>This document uses &ldquo;user&rdquo; or &ldquo;users&rdquo; as interchangeable with &ldquo;data subject&rdquo; or &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; or other equivalent terms from various rules. </p><p>When we say rules, we mean laws, regulations, and industry self-regulatory codes that are applicable to the processing of personal data in relation to Quantcast&rsquo;s services. Quantcast has a global footprint, including operations in the EU, the UK, and the US (including California), so those jurisdictions&rsquo; rules are applicable to Quantcast for data about users who reside in those jurisdictions.  </p><p>We also will use &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; as interchangeable with terms such as, &ldquo;personal information.&rdquo; Personal data processed by Quantcast&rsquo;s service is pseudonymous, including but not limited to IP address, cookie or device IDs, and other identifiers used for advertising-related purposes. In the case where a partner has express permission from Quantcast to use email address, phone number, or other directly identifying information, such information will be pseudonymized (usually hashed or encrypted,) according to Quantcast specifications, before transmitting to Quantcast.</p><p><u>Industry standards and self-regulatory programs</u></p><p>Quantcast supports and participates in industry self-regulatory programs, and generally implements industry standards and best practices when it comes to handling personal data. Partners and clients are responsible for ensuring their own implementation of self-regulatory rules and industry best practices, in particular related to providing transparency and choice to users in places where data is collected or used by Quantcast&rsquo;s services. </p><p><u>Controller, processor, service provider, vendor, etc.</u></p><p>Unfortunately, terms describing the relationships between parties sharing data are not interchangeable. Quantcast determines its role based on applicable law and the facts of its processing of personal data. In many relationships with advertiser partners or clients, Quantcast is a controller or joint controller, because of the role that Quantcast plays in defining exactly how data is used. This does not mean Quantcast has unfettered rights to use this data; rather, Quantcast&rsquo;s use of the data is usually restricted by contractual limitations. If you have questions about this, please consult your agreement or ask your account representative.</p><p>Advertisers: Where the EU GDPR or the UK GDPR applies, Quantcast is a joint controller of personal data collected using Quantcast tags and pixels and of other personal data introduced into Quantcast&rsquo;s services by the advertiser. Where US state privacy law applies, Quantcast acts as a &ldquo;third party.&rdquo;</p><p><u>Notice/Transparency and Choice</u></p><p>Laws, self-regulatory rules, and industry best practice require users be notified about processing of personal data, and be offered a choice &ndash; either opt in or opt out &mdash; with respect to that processing. </p><p>When deploying Quantcast tags or pixels, or otherwise introducing data into Quantcast&rsquo;s services, partners and clients are responsible to make sure that users are given notice and choice that is required for Quantcast to be able to collect and process the data. And, of course, partners and clients have to make sure of notice and choice for their own personal data collection and processing.</p><p>Generally, notice must include the fact that third parties are collecting and processing users&rsquo; data, along with information about the data collected, the means of collection, the purposes for processing (including interest-based advertising), and how users can exercise their choices. Laws or rules in some jurisdictions would require that Quantcast be specifically identified in the notice and a link to Quantcast&rsquo;s <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#products-and-services-privacy-policy">privacy policy</a> be included. </p><p>Quantcast&rsquo;s methods of collection include, depending on particular circumstances, cookies, pixels, JavaScript tags, probabilistic device matching and cross-device matching (using passively collected data).</p><p>Quantcast implements choice using industry standard methods and will be responsible for honoring that choice with respect to personal data within Quantcast&rsquo;s services. </p><p>For their part, partners and clients need to provide access to the choice using industry standard and legally compliant methods, depending on the applicable laws and rules. Usually this means providing access to choose within other privacy disclosures, including in a privacy policy.</p><p>In all cases, partners and clients should have user-facing privacy policies that are prominently linked from their homepages and from content (sites, apps, etc.) where personal data are collected or used. </p><p>Privacy policies will adhere to applicable laws, as well as industry self-regulatory requirements and industry best practices. At minimum, policies should disclose the fact that third parties are collecting personal data for advertising-related purposes, and should describe the methods of collection, as described above. Particular circumstances and applicable rules may create additional requirements.</p><p>Where consent (opt-in) is required prior to setting cookies or collecting data, such as in Europe under ePrivacy, the GDPR, and the UK GDPR, partners and clients are responsible to make sure that tags or pixels don&rsquo;t fire until that consent is obtained. </p><p><strong>EU and the UK: </strong>The industry standard means for ensuring notice and choice for vendors like Quantcast in the EU and the UK is the IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework.

Because Quantcast&rsquo;s services are not intended for processing data regarded as &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; or &ldquo;special category&rdquo; under applicable law or data about children under the age of 16, partners and clients must not transmit to Quantcast or cause Quantcast to collect any such data.

We need to use these vendors to deliver and measure the advertising campaigns that we serve. To do this, these vendors collect and use certain identifiers, such as the IP address of the visitor to the digital platform (e.g. to deliver the ad to that visitor&rsquo;s browser or device) and an identifier specific to the advertisement (so they can identify the ad they need to serve and measure).</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Partner</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Opt-Out Link or Contact</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Advanse, LLC</p></td><td><p><a href="https://advanseads.com/advanse-privacy-policy-page/"><u>Privacy Policy</u></a></p></td><td><p><a href="https://advanseads.com/advanse-privacy-policy-page/"><u>Opt Out Link</u></a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Google LLC (fka Doubleclick, a division of Google Inc.)</p></td><td><p><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"><u>Privacy Policy</u></a></p></td><td><p><a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en&ref_topic=7048998"><u>Opt Out Link</u></a></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jivox Corporation</p></td><td><p><a href="https://www.jivox.com/privacy/"><u>Privacy Policy</u></a></p></td><td><p><a href="https://www.jivox.com/privacy/opt-out/"><u>Opt Out Link</u></a></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Ad Verification</strong></p><p>These companies provide a technology to ensure that digital advertisements appear on intended sites and reach the targeted audience; examples include measuring the viewability of an ad, brand safety and fraud (e.g., whether a site is safe for the particular advertiser&rsquo;s brand or whether it is a fraudulent site).

Quantcast offers Solutions that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, &ldquo;Clients&rdquo;) understand and grow their client base. Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and Audiences with the right advertising. We will refer to all of these services as &ldquo;Solutions.&rdquo;</p><p>To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses Personal Information for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the <a href="#_2et92p0"><u>Information Collection</u></a> section below, we may join or match Personal Information about you, which may include your Online Data from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (&ldquo;CTVs&rdquo;)), that have implemented Quantcast Pixels, Tags or SDKs (which is sometimes called &ldquo;tracking&rdquo; in the industry) or Offline Data . This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine Personal Information that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called Cross-Media Matching/Linking. To the extent that we combine Personal Information that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect Personal Information, otherwise obtain and Process it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights.

Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, &ldquo;Clients&rdquo;) understand and grow their client base. Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and Audiences with the right advertising. We will refer to all of these services as &ldquo;Solutions.&rdquo;</p><p>To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses Personal Information for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the <a href="#information-collection"><u>Information Collection</u></a> section below, we may join or match Personal Information about you, which may include your Online Data from your visits across different digital properties, like websites,mobile apps, or streaming media devices (such as connected TVs (&ldquo;CTVs&rdquo;)), that have implemented Quantcast Pixels, Tags or SDKs (which is sometimes called &ldquo;tracking&rdquo; in the industry) or Offline Data . This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine Personal Information that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called Cross-Media Matching/Linking. To the extent that we combine Personal Information that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect Personal Information, otherwise obtain and Process it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights. As noted in the <a href="#information-use-and-legal-basis"><u>Information use and legal basis</u></a> section below, we use the <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/"><u>Transparency and Consent Framework</u></a> (&ldquo;TCF&rdquo;) standard to facilitate compliance with applicable laws in Europe, primarily in accordance with the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation (&ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;). Because the TCF is one means of explaining Processing activities, and because our Processing activities are consistent globally, the TCF Purposes are applicable to all Personal Information that we Process (regardless of the information&rsquo;s country of origin).</p><p>In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107.

Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these  digital businesses better connect their content and <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms">Audiences </a>with the right advertising.</p><p dir="ltr">To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms">Personal Information</a> for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes.

Quantcast offers products and services that help digital advertisers and publishers (collectively, &ldquo;<strong>Clients</strong>&rdquo;) understand and grow their audiences (the &ldquo;<strong>Solutions</strong>&rdquo;). Through Quantcast Advertise Solutions, advertiser Clients can plan, activate, and measure the performance of their advertising campaigns seamlessly in a single audience platform, which helps them to place their ads to maximise results. Through Quantcast Measure Solutions, digital publisher Clients leverage insights to better understand the makeup of their audiences, how audiences spend their time across their digital properties, and what audiences care about, all of which help these digital businesses better connect their content and <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Audiences </u></a>with the right advertising.</div><div>To provide the Solutions, Quantcast collects and uses <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Personal Information</u></a> for various purposes, such as measuring and understanding audiences, targeting and delivering ads, measuring ad performance, and similar related purposes. As described in the &ldquo;<a href="https://app.pactsafe.com/contracts/337835/edit#_heading=h.tyjcwt"><u>Information Collection</u></a>&rdquo; section below, we may join or match Personal Information about you, which may include your <a href="https://legal.quantcast.com/#key-terms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Online Data </u></a>from your visits across different digital properties, like websites or mobile apps, that have implemented Quantcast Pixels, Tags or SDKs (which is sometimes called &ldquo;tracking&rdquo; in the industry) or Offline Data . This allows us, for example, to enrich our existing data sets and provide meaningful reports for our Clients regarding the effectiveness of their ads or content. We may also combine Personal Information that we collect in order to probabilistically link media consumption to a single user, which is sometimes called Cross-Media Matching/Linking. To the extent that we combine Personal Information that we collect from and about you in connection with our performance of the Solutions, we will use such combined information only as described in this Privacy Policy.</div><div>This Privacy Policy describes in more detail how we collect, use, disclose, and protect Personal Information, otherwise obtain and Process it in connection with the delivery of the Solutions, and the controls we provide you to manage such information and exercise your choices and legal rights.

Because the TCF is one means of explaining Processing activities, and because our Processing activities are consistent globally, the TCF Purposes are applicable to all Personal Information that we Process (regardless of the information&rsquo;s country of origin).</div><div>In the United States, the Solutions are provided by Quantcast Corporation, located at 795 Folsom Street, San Francisco, CA 94107.

The Services may permit Company to purchase ad placements on third-party media (e.g., webpages, apps, video, and other content/properties) (&ldquo;<strong>Inventory</strong>&rdquo;) that are made available by third-party providers (&ldquo;<strong>Inventory Providers</strong>&rdquo;) and Third-Party Services (defined below). For clarity, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo; do not include Inventory or Third-Party Services.</p><p>2.2. Some Services may be subject to different or additional terms (&ldquo;<strong>Additional Terms</strong>&rdquo;) that are described on the Additional Terms page linked above, in the Platform or otherwise made available to Company in writing. Unless the parties agree in writing for Quantcast to provide campaign management services or professional services, the Services do not include those services.</p><h1><a id="_lhtfv7mez7uq"></a><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">3.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 18px;"> <strong>Accounts and Authorized Users</strong></span></h1><p>3.1. Company will ensure its account information is accurate and current. Company will promptly notify Quantcast of any accidental disclosure or unauthorized use of Company access credentials. Quantcast</p><p>may review and, if needed, correct, the information and setup associated with Company&rsquo;s account and Authorized Users. Company must obtain Quantcast&rsquo;s prior written consent before adding third-party Authorized Users (i.e., non-employees) and Quantcast may require such third-party Authorized Users to enter into separate terms with Quantcast.</p><p>3.2. &ldquo;<strong>Authorized User</strong>&rdquo; means an individual authorized by Company to use Company&rsquo;s account on the Platform. Each Authorized User must use unique access credentials. Company is solely responsible for all Authorized Users, the level of permissioning of each Authorized User, and all activity under its account, including the confidentiality of all access credentials. Without limiting the foregoing, Company will immediately notify Quantcast of any accidental disclosure or unauthorized use of any access credentials. Company will ensure that all Authorized Users use Company&rsquo;s account solely on behalf of Company, and are aware of, and comply with, this Agreement.

Company will only use the Services for Clients with which Company has a direct written agency agreement and will obligate its Clients to comply with this Agreement, including the Incorporated Terms.

Unless Quantcast approves a different payment arrangement in writing, Company authorizes Quantcast to charge amounts owed under this Agreement to Company&rsquo;s credit card, via automatic ACH, or such other similar payment method, at Quantcast&rsquo;s option. Company will provide its most current credit card and/or other information required to complete payment, and keep such information updated if it changes. For the avoidance of doubt, if Company makes credit card, wire transfer or ACH payments or such other similar payment method, Company agrees to the applicable third-party terms as set forth in the Additional Terms. If Quantcast authorizes Company to pay invoices in arrears, Company will pay invoices within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Quantcast may revise Company&rsquo;s credit limit or require prepayment at any time in its sole discretion. Quantcast may charge interest at a rate of 2% per month (or the legal maximum, whichever is lower) for late payments. Company is responsible for reasonable out-of-pocket costs that Quantcast incurs to collect unpaid invoices. All payment obligations are non-cancelable and all amounts paid for Services provided are non-refundable. If Company requires a purchase order to make payments, Company will include the corresponding purchase order number in the Platform. All amounts due must be paid without setoff or deduction.</p><p>5.3. Company is solely responsible for all amounts due for any Third-Party Services that Company opts to use. Company acknowledges that any charges for Third-Party Services shown in the Platform or otherwise provided by Quantcast are based on the information Quantcast receives from the third parties and are subject to the final amounts charged by such third parties.</p><p>5.4. Quantcast is the system of record and is solely responsible for calculating all metrics related to the Services, including all amounts owed under this Agreement. Company acknowledges that all metrics, fees and other amounts shown in Platform are preliminary and final amounts will be as confirmed, invoiced or billed by Quantcast.</p><p>5.5. All charges under this Agreement are exclusive of all taxes and duties, if any. Company is responsible for and must pay all sales and use or other transactional taxes and duties including interest and penalty imposed on the amounts charged hereunder, or from the performance of this Agreement for which Quantcast issues an invoice.

For example, Company may not create an audience of a particular publisher&rsquo;s end users based on information derived or obtained by using the Services.</p><p>6.4. For the avoidance of doubt, Quantcast may collect analytics information about its customers&rsquo; use of the Services (e.g., how Authorized Users engage with the Platform user interface, etc.) for purposes of understanding how its customers use the Services and providing, customizing, and improving the Services.</p><p>6.5. Quantcast reserves the right but not the obligation to place the AdChoices icon (or a similar icon) on Ads that do not already include such icon.</p><p>6.6. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither party grants the other party any rights, express or implied, and each party reserves all rights.

For the avoidance of doubt, Campaign Data does not include Tag Data.</p><p>7.1.3. &ldquo;<strong>Campaign Tag</strong>&rdquo; means a tag, pixel or other element provided by Quantcast to Company for Company or Clients to place on Company Media to enable the collection of Tag Data under this Agreement. For clarity, the term &ldquo;Campaign Tags&rdquo; does not refer to any ad serving tags or Measure tags provided by Quantcast (i.e., if Company elects to use Quantcast ad serving or Quantcast Measure).</p><p>7.1.4. &ldquo;<strong>Company Data</strong>&rdquo; means all information and materials that are onboarded to Company&rsquo;s account in the Platform, whether directly or via a third-party (e.g., an onboarding service provider).</p><p>Without limiting the foregoing, Company Data includes all Campaign parameters (the data entered into the Platform for a Campaign such as name, budget, targeting strategy, etc.), Tag Data and any data onboarded by or on behalf of Company (e.g., first and/or third-party audiences).

Some Platform Data may be presented to Company in the Platform user interface while other Platform Data may be used by the Platform on the back end (i.e., behind the scenes) to provide the Services. Platform Data is a subset of Quantcast&rsquo;s Confidential Information.</p><p>7.1.8. &ldquo;<strong>Tag Data</strong>&rdquo; means the data collected via Campaign Tags.</p><p>7.2. <u>Company Data</u>: As between the parties, Company Data is the exclusive property of Company and/or the applicable Client. As to all Company Data (whether provided by Company, Client or a third-party on Company&rsquo;s or a Client&rsquo;s behalf), Company represents and warrants that it has sufficient rights to provide Company Data for use by Quantcast in compliance with this Agreement. Quantcast may use Company Data solely in compliance with the DPAs (including to create Models for Company, deliver Campaigns and create audience insights, etc.). Quantcast will not share Company</p><p>Data with any third-party except to the extent that Company requests third-party services that utilize Company Data (e.g., third-party measurement), Company Data is included as a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company. In addition, Quantcast may use non- Company-identifiable inferences made from Tag Data to produce, and as contained in, the Aggregated Data.</p><p>7.3. <u>Platform Data</u>: As between the parties, Platform Data is the exclusive property of Quantcast (or its third-party partners). Company may use Platform Data (whether directly, to the extent presented to Company in the Platform, or indirectly, to the extent used by the Platform to enable the Services) solely internally and solely for the purpose of using the Services as described in this Agreement. As to any Platform Data that Company can access and export using the self-serve features of the Platform, Company will not share such Platform Data with any third-party except, if applicable, Company&rsquo;s Client(s) that such Platform Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement<em>. </em>If Quantcast provides Company with Platform Data outside the self-serve features of the Platform (e.g., further detail about available audiences, etc.), such Platform Data is subject to any applicable Additional Terms.

Quantcast is not responsible for Third-Party Services and makes no representations as to such services, including their privacy practices.

Confidential Information does not include information that the receiving party can demonstrate: (a) it knew without restriction before receipt from the disclosing party, (b) is publicly available through no fault of the receiving party, (c) it rightfully received from a third-party without a duty of confidentiality, or (d) is independently developed without use of or reference to Confidential Information. The receiving party may use Confidential Information only to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and must use at least reasonable care to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information, but in any event no less stringent a standard than receiving party applies to its own Confidential Information. The receiving party may share Confidential Information with its employees, agents and contractors who need to know it, as long as they are bound to confidentiality obligations that are consistent with this Agreement, provided that the receiving party shall remain solely responsible for their compliance with this Agreement. If compelled to do so by law, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as long as it provides reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (unless legally prohibited). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Quantcast from using and sharing high level data that is compiled and summarized from the combination of Campaign Data with equivalent data generated by campaigns of other Quantcast customers, that does not allow identification of Company or Clients.

The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement or compromise that does not fully absolve the indemnified party of liability.</p><p>12.3.

If Company asks Quantcast to take actions on behalf of Company or otherwise assist with Company&rsquo;s use of the Services, Company consents to the actions and/or inactions that Quantcast takes on its behalf and retains sole responsibility for such assisted use of the Services.</p><p>6.3. Company will not: (a) attempt to circumvent any Services security measure, (b) share its access credentials, (c) grant direct or indirect access to the Services to any third-party (other than an Authorized User of a Client, if applicable), (d) reproduce, distribute, modify, prepare derivative works of, translate, reverse engineer, reverse compile, or disassemble the Services, including Platform Data, (e) introduce viruses or other malware into the Services or to end users, (f) share reports generated by the Services with any third-party (other than the relevant Client who is obligated to treat such reports confidentially) or (g) use information collected during the course of Campaigns (e.g., via Company&rsquo;s own tag, third party tags, etc.) outside Company&rsquo;s use of the Services, including to create or enrich profiles of individual end users, including regarding third-party media (e.g., webpages, apps, video and other content/properties) that the end users have visited or the content or general interest area of such media. For example, Company may not create an audience of a particular publisher&rsquo;s end users based on information derived or obtained by using the Services.</p><p>6.4. For the avoidance of doubt, Quantcast may collect analytics information about its customers&rsquo; use of the Services (e.g., how Authorized Users engage with the Platform user interface, etc.) for purposes of understanding how its customers use the Services and providing, customizing, and improving the Services.</p><p>6.5. Quantcast reserves the right but not the obligation to place the AdChoices icon (or a similar icon) on Ads that do not already include such icon.</p><p>6.6. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither party grants the other party any rights, express or implied, and each party reserves all rights. If Company provides Quantcast with feedback regarding the Services, Company hereby grants Quantcast a perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid up right and license to such feedback, without accounting, attribution, or compensation to Company.</p><h1><a id="_e5c6lebikq5b"></a><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">7.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 18px;"> </span><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Data Issues</span></strong></h1><p>7.1. Data Definitions<strong>:</strong></p><p>7.1.1. &ldquo;<strong>Aggregated Data</strong>&rdquo; means generalized, combined data from numerous campaigns of multiple Quantcast customers, including Company, that concerns campaign parameters, goals, or performance results of such campaigns and that does not permit identification of Company or any other Quantcast customer of the Services.</p><p>7.1.2. &ldquo;<strong>Campaign Data</strong>&rdquo; means the campaign-related reporting data generated in the course of the Services and provided to Company under this Agreement, such as Campaign performance reports. For the avoidance of doubt, Campaign Data does not include Tag Data.</p><p>7.1.3. &ldquo;<strong>Campaign Tag</strong>&rdquo; means a tag, pixel or other element provided by Quantcast to Company for Company or Clients to place on Company Media to enable the collection of Tag Data under this Agreement. For clarity, the term &ldquo;Campaign Tags&rdquo; does not refer to any ad serving tags or Measure tags provided by Quantcast (i.e., if Company elects to use Quantcast ad serving or Quantcast Measure).</p><p>7.1.4. &ldquo;<strong>Company Data</strong>&rdquo; means all information and materials that are onboarded to Company&rsquo;s account in the Platform, whether directly or via a third-party (e.g., an onboarding service provider).</p><p>Without limiting the foregoing, Company Data includes all Campaign parameters (the data entered into the Platform for a Campaign such as name, budget, targeting strategy, etc.), Tag Data and any data onboarded by or on behalf of Company (e.g., first and/or third-party audiences). Company Data is a subset of Company&rsquo;s Confidential Information.</p><p>7.1.5. &ldquo;<strong>Company Media</strong>&rdquo; means the Ads, websites, apps and other digital properties and content on which Company or Clients place Campaign Tags.</p><p>7.1.6. &ldquo;<strong>Model</strong>&rdquo; means the predictive profile of shared attributes and characteristics of a group of end users that Company desires to reach in a Campaign, created algorithmically by deriving observations from Company Data and Platform Data. For the avoidance of doubt, Models do not include any data at individual end user level or any end user-level identifiers that may be used to distinguish one end user from another end user (such as an end user ID or IP address).</p><p>7.1.7. &ldquo;<strong>Platform Data</strong>&rdquo; means the data residing in the Platform or otherwise generated or used in connection with the Services that does not constitute Company Data or Campaign Data, including Aggregated Data, Models, and third-party data (&ldquo;<strong>Third-Party Data</strong>&rdquo;). Some Platform Data may be presented to Company in the Platform user interface while other Platform Data may be used by the Platform on the back end (i.e., behind the scenes) to provide the Services. Platform Data is a subset of Quantcast&rsquo;s Confidential Information.</p><p>7.1.8. &ldquo;<strong>Tag Data</strong>&rdquo; means the data collected via Campaign Tags.</p><p>7.2. <u>Company Data</u>: As between the parties, Company Data is the exclusive property of Company and/or the applicable Client. As to all Company Data (whether provided by Company, Client or a third-party on Company&rsquo;s or a Client&rsquo;s behalf), Company represents and warrants that it has sufficient rights to provide Company Data for use by Quantcast in compliance with this Agreement. Quantcast may use Company Data solely in compliance with the DPAs (including to create Models for Company, deliver Campaigns and create audience insights, etc.). Quantcast will not share Company</p><p>Data with any third-party except to the extent that Company requests third-party services that utilize Company Data (e.g., third-party measurement), Company Data is included as a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company. In addition, Quantcast may use non- Company-identifiable inferences made from Tag Data to produce, and as contained in, the Aggregated Data.</p><p>7.3. <u>Platform Data</u>: As between the parties, Platform Data is the exclusive property of Quantcast (or its third-party partners). Company may use Platform Data (whether directly, to the extent presented to Company in the Platform, or indirectly, to the extent used by the Platform to enable the Services) solely internally and solely for the purpose of using the Services as described in this Agreement. As to any Platform Data that Company can access and export using the self-serve features of the Platform, Company will not share such Platform Data with any third-party except, if applicable, Company&rsquo;s Client(s) that such Platform Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement<em>. </em>If Quantcast provides Company with Platform Data outside the self-serve features of the Platform (e.g., further detail about available audiences, etc.), such Platform Data is subject to any applicable Additional Terms. Company will not attempt to extract or recreate any Third-Party Data or other Platform Data that is not readily accessible via the normal functionality presented in the Platform or assemble similar data or audience segments itself (directly or indirectly through a third-party) on the basis of Third-Party Data or other Platform Data or information derived from the use of such data under this Agreement.</p><p>7.4. <u>Campaign Data</u>: Company may use Campaign Data for its internal business purposes provided that (a) it complies with its privacy policy, (b) it complies with the terms of this Agreement, and (c) it does not disclose Campaign Data to any third-party except, if applicable, Company&rsquo;s Client(s) that such Campaign Data pertains to and/or third-party service providers who are each under confidentiality restrictions, and subject to the terms of this Agreement. Quantcast may use Campaign Data (i) to provide the Services, and (ii) within a customary field in the data accessible to Inventory Providers and other technical service providers (e.g., bidstream and reporting data) or as otherwise authorized by Company.</p><p>7.5. <u>Models</u>: Models reside solely within the Platform and are not directly accessible to Company. Company&rsquo;s license above includes the ability to use Models as an integrated part of the Services, solely for the purpose of selecting and gaining insights about the end users that Company wishes to reach with its Campaigns. Quantcast will not share Models generated for the purpose of Company&rsquo;s Campaigns with other customers.</p><p>7.6. <u>Client Data</u>: Upon request from a Client (or an authorized third party on Client&rsquo;s behalf, including Company), Quantcast is authorized to use the Client Data associated with such Client in accordance with such request (including sharing such Client Data with another entity within the Quantcast Platform). For clarity, &ldquo;<strong>Client Data</strong>&rdquo; means the (i) Tag Data from Client websites, apps and/or other digital properties; and (ii) Quantcast&rsquo;s proprietary analysis of such data. Client Data does not include any predictive models or data segments created using the Tag Data or any Campaign Data generated from Campaigns delivered using such Client Data.</p><p>7.7. <u>No Off-Platform Use</u>: Company will not use the Services, the Campaign Data, or any information derived from the Services, Models or Campaign Data to create or enrich profiles of individual end users or to retarget any end user except via the Services.</p><h1><a id="_s0d545vdo39x"></a><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">8.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 18px;"> </span><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Compliance and Privacy</span></strong></h1><p>8.1. Each party will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (Quantcast in its provision of the Services in the form provided by Quantcast and Company in its use of the Services), including Applicable Privacy Laws and applicable self-regulatory principles, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance&rsquo;s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (&ldquo;<strong>DAA</strong>&rdquo;) or the Network Advertising Initiative Code of Conduct (&ldquo;<strong>NAI</strong>&rdquo;). &ldquo;<strong>Applicable Privacy Laws</strong>&rdquo; means US State Privacy Laws and International Privacy Laws (defined in the linked DPAs). Company will comply with the Incorporated Terms.</p><p>8.2. Company will not use the Service or any Third Party Service with any (a) Direct Identifiers, any special or sensitive categories of personal data as defined by Applicable Privacy Laws, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media whose content reveals special or sensitive categories of personal data of an end user, or personal data relating to criminal offenses or criminal convictions; or</p><p>(b) any data of children, including by placing Campaign Tags on Ads or Company Media directed at children; or (c) data related to any end user that has requested deletion or opted out (collectively, &ldquo;<strong>Prohibited Data</strong>&rdquo;). &ldquo;<strong>Direct Identifier</strong>&rdquo; means any information that identifies a particular individual without additional information, including name, address, mobile number, email address, financial account number or government-issued identifier. Direct Identifiers do not include pseudonymous identifiers such as IP address, cookie ID and certain hashed identifiers (e.g., email addresses that have been encoded using a cryptographic hashing function to obfuscate the email). For purposes of this Agreement, &ldquo;<strong>children</strong>&rdquo; refers to anyone age 16 or under or such other age specified by Applicable Privacy Laws under which the processing of personal information is prohibited or requires opt-in or parental consent.</p><p>8.3. Company represents and warrants that it is not a covered entity under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (&ldquo;HIPAA&rdquo;), and does not have equivalent status under comparable local or international laws and regulations. If Company is using the Services on behalf of Clients, Company represents and warrants that Clients are not covered entities under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (&ldquo;HIPAA&rdquo;), and do not have equivalent status under comparable local or international laws and regulations.</p><h1><a id="_9azl4ib469sp"></a><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">9.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 18px;"> <strong>Third-Party Services</strong></span></h1><p>9.1. If Company uses any third-party branded product or service in connection with the Services (including Third-Party Data made available for use via the Services) (&ldquo;<strong>Third-Party Service</strong>&rdquo;), the following additional terms apply.</p><p>9.2. Company is solely responsible for complying with any applicable third-party terms and requirements. For Third-Party Services offered via the Platform, such third-party terms and requirements may be provided in the Platform, the Additional Terms, otherwise by Quantcast or by the third-party.</p><p>9.3. Quantcast is not responsible for Third-Party Services and makes no representations as to such services, including their privacy practices. Quantcast cannot guarantee continued availability or pricing of Third-Party Services and may stop enabling access to them without liability. Company may be required to register for or log into Third-Party Services on their respective websites or to share Company Data with Third-Party Services (e.g., services requiring data integration).</p><h1><a id="_gxshbndiwv59"></a><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">10.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 18px;"> </span><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Marketing, Publicity</span></strong></h1><p>Quantcast may include Company&rsquo;s name and logo in descriptions of Quantcast&rsquo;s partners on its website, in media, in promotional materials, and in the Platform. Company will not use Quantcast&rsquo;s name or logo without prior written permission. All goodwill from the use of Quantcast&rsquo;s name or logo inures to Quantcast. Neither party will make a press release or any other public statement about this Agreement without the other party&rsquo;s prior agreement.</p><h1><a id="_nucr56napxu3"></a><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">11.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 18px;"> </span><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Confidentiality</span></strong></h1><p>&ldquo;<strong>Confidential Information</strong>&rdquo; means information that the disclosing party identifies as confidential or the receiving party should reasonably understand to be confidential given the circumstances of the disclosure and the nature of the information. Confidential Information does not include information that the receiving party can demonstrate: (a) it knew without restriction before receipt from the disclosing party, (b) is publicly available through no fault of the receiving party, (c) it rightfully received from a third-party without a duty of confidentiality, or (d) is independently developed without use of or reference to Confidential Information. The receiving party may use Confidential Information only to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and must use at least reasonable care to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information, but in any event no less stringent a standard than receiving party applies to its own Confidential Information. The receiving party may share Confidential Information with its employees, agents and contractors who need to know it, as long as they are bound to confidentiality obligations that are consistent with this Agreement, provided that the receiving party shall remain solely responsible for their compliance with this Agreement. If compelled to do so by law, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as long as it provides reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (unless legally prohibited). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Quantcast from using and sharing high level data that is compiled and summarized from the combination of Campaign Data with equivalent data generated by campaigns of other Quantcast customers, that does not allow identification of Company or Clients. Company will delete all Quantcast Confidential Information promptly upon termination of this Agreement.</p><h1><a id="_r2x9udafs8ng"></a><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">12.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 18px;"> </span><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Indemnity</span></strong></h1><p>12.1.

The indemnified party will promptly notify the indemnifying party of any indemnified claim (provided that failure to notify promptly will only relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations to the extent it demonstrates material prejudice from the failure) and at the indemnifying party&rsquo;s expense, provide assistance reasonably necessary to defend such claim. The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement or compromise that does not fully absolve the indemnified party of liability.</p><p>12.3. Quantcast will have no obligation for any claim arising from or related to (a) compliance with Company specifications, (b) combination of the Services with products or services not supplied by Quantcast, (c) adaptation or modification of the Services or Campaign Data, (d) Company&rsquo;s failure to follow instructions provided by Quantcast that would have cured the cause of action, (e) use of the Services or Campaign Data other than as described herein, or (f) Inventory or Third-Party Services selected and/or purchased by Company. In such cases, Company will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Quantcast Parties from and against any Liabilities arising directly or indirectly from such claims.</p><p>12.4. If Quantcast&rsquo;s right to provide the Services is enjoined or in Quantcast&rsquo;s opinion is likely to be enjoined, Quantcast may obtain the right to continue providing the Services, replace or modify the Services so that they become non-infringing or terminate this Agreement.

The receiving party may share Confidential Information with its employees, agents and contractors who need to know it, as long as they are bound to confidentiality obligations that are consistent with this Agreement, provided that the receiving party shall remain solely responsible for their compliance with this Agreement. If compelled to do so by law, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as long as it provides reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (unless legally prohibited).  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Quantcast from using and sharing high level data that is compiled and summarized from the combination of Campaign Data with equivalent data generated by campaigns of other Quantcast customers, that does not allow identification of Company or Clients.

The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement or compromise that does not fully absolve the indemnified party of liability.   </div><div style="margin-left: 20px;">12.3.

The receiving party may share Confidential Information with its employees, agents and contractors who need to know it, as long as they are bound to confidentiality obligations that are consistent with this Agreement, provided that the receiving party shall remain solely responsible for their compliance with this Agreement. If compelled to do so by law, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as long as it provides reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (unless legally prohibited).  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement prohibits Quantcast from using and sharing high level data that is compiled and summarized from the combination of Campaign Data with equivalent data generated by campaigns of other Quantcast customers, that does not allow identification of Company or Clients.

The indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement or compromise that does not fully absolve the indemnified party of liability.   </div><div style="margin-left: 20px;">12.3.

Confidential Information does not include information that the receiving party can demonstrate: (a) it knew without restriction before receipt from the disclosing party, (b) is publicly available through no fault of the receiving party, (c) it rightfully received from a third-party without a duty of confidentiality, or (d) is independently developed without use of or reference to Confidential Information. The receiving party may use Confidential Information only to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and must use at least reasonable care to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information, but in any event no less stringent a standard than receiving party applies to its own Confidential Information. The receiving party may share Confidential Information with its employees, agents and contractors who need to know it, as long as they are bound to confidentiality obligations that are consistent with this Agreement, provided that the receiving party shall remain solely responsible for their compliance with this Agreement. If compelled to do so by law, the receiving party may disclose Confidential Information as long as it provides reasonable prior notice to the disclosing party (unless legally prohibited).
